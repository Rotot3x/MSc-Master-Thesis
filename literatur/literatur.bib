  abstract = {In the proposed protocol, a trusted entity interacts with the terminal device of each user to verify the legitimacy of the public keys without having access to the private keys that are generated and kept totally secret by the user. The protocol introduces challenge–response–pair mechanisms enabling the generation, distribution, and verification of cryptographic public–private key pairs in a distributed network with multi-factor authentication, tokens, and template-less biometry. While protocols using generic digital signature algorithms are proposed, the focus of the experimental work was to implement a solution based on Crystals-Dilithium, a post-quantum cryptographic algorithm under standardization. Crystals-Dilithium generates public keys consisting of two interrelated parts, a matrix generating seed, and a vector computed from the matrix and two randomly picked vectors forming the secret key. We show how such a split of the public keys lends itself to a two-way authentication of both the trusted entity and the users.},

  abstract = {Blockchain technology has gained significant attention in recent years for its potential to revolutionize various sectors, including finance, supply chain management, and digital forensics. While blockchain’s decentralization enhances security, it complicates the identification and tracking of illegal activities, making it challenging to link blockchain addresses to real-world identities. Also, although immutability protects against tampering, it introduces challenges for forensic investigations as it prevents the modification or deletion of evidence, even if it is fraudulent. Hence, this paper provides a systematic literature review and examination of state-of-the-art studies in blockchain forensics to offer a comprehensive understanding of the topic. This paper provides a comprehensive investigation of the fundamental principles of blockchain forensics, exploring various techniques and applications for conducting digital forensic investigations in blockchain. Based on the selected search strategy, 46 articles (out of 672) were chosen for closer examination. The contributions of these articles were discussed and summarized, highlighting their strengths and limitations. This paper examines the selected papers to identify diverse digital forensic frameworks and methodologies used in blockchain forensics, as well as how blockchain-based forensic solutions have enhanced forensic investigations. In addition, this paper discusses the common applications of blockchain-based forensic frameworks and examines the associated legal and regulatory challenges encountered in conducting a forensic investigation within blockchain systems. Open issues and future research directions of blockchain forensics were also discussed. This paper provides significant value for researchers, digital forensic practitioners, and investigators by providing a comprehensive and up-to-date review of existing research and identifying key challenges and opportunities related to blockchain forensics.},

  abstract = {Creating search strategies for systematic reviews, finding the best balance between sensitivity and specificity, and translating search strategies between databases is challenging. Several methods describe standards for systematic search strategies, but a consistent approach for creating an exhaustive search strategy has not yet been fully described in enough detail to be fully replicable. The authors have established a method that describes step by step the process of developing a systematic search strategy as needed in the systematic review. This method describes how single-line search strategies can be prepared in a text document by typing search syntax (such as field codes, parentheses, and Boolean operators) before copying and pasting search terms (keywords and free-text synonyms) that are found in the thesaurus. To help ensure term completeness, we developed a novel optimization technique that is mainly based on comparing the results retrieved by thesaurus terms with those retrieved by the free-text search words to identify potentially relevant candidate search terms. Macros in Microsoft Word have been developed to convert syntaxes between databases and interfaces almost automatically. This method helps information specialists in developing librarian-mediated searches for systematic reviews as well as medical and health care practitioners who are searching for evidence to answer clinical questions. The described method can be used to create complex and comprehensive search strategies for different databases and interfaces, such as those that are needed when searching for relevant references for systematic reviews, and will assist both information specialists and practitioners when they are searching the biomedical literature.},

  abstract = {The “standing on the shoulders of giants” metaphor is often used to acknowledge the work of others when undertaking research and, in particular, stresses the importance of literature reviews in scientific inquiry. Though the significance of literature reviews has never been in doubt, researchers, especially novice researchers, still struggle with developing effective strategies for reviewing literature. An important reason for this difficulty is the rapidly increasing number of potentially relevant publications—not all of which necessarily add value to a literature review. As such, avoiding standing on the shoulders of dwarfs literature search emerges as a major issue in crafting an effective literature review. In this paper, we discuss challenges of literature searches in the increasingly dynamic context of information systems (IS) research and make recommendations for how to deal with them. We present practical guidelines and a checklist to help researchers with planning and organizing their literature searches. Download: http://aisel.aisnet.org/cais/vol37/iss1/9/},

  abstract = {The advent of quantum computers brought a large interest in post-quantum cryptography and in the migration to quantum-resistant systems. Protocols for Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) are among the fundamental scenarios touched by this need. The core concept of SSI is to move the control of digital identity from third-party identity providers directly to individuals. This is achieved through Verificable Credentials (VCs) supporting anonymity and selective disclosure. In turn, the implementation of VCs requires cryptographic signature schemes compatible with a proper Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) framework. We describe the two main ZKP VCs schemes based on classical cryptographic assumptions, that is, the signature scheme with efficient protocols of Camenisch and Lysyanskaya, which is based on the strong RSA assumption, and the BBS+ scheme of Boneh, Boyen and Shacham, which is based on the strong Diffie-Hellman assumption. Since these schemes are not quantum-resistant, we select as one of the possible post-quantum alternatives a lattice-based scheme proposed by Jeudy, Roux-Langlois, and Sander, and we try to identify the open problems for achieving VCs suitable for selective disclosure, non-interactive renewal mechanisms, and efficient revocation.},

This paper provides comprehensive guidance for this transition, addressing the challenges of quantum computing to current cryptographic systems. It presents a framework for the efficient and timely adoption of PQC within critical infrastructure. The study examines the current development of PQC, evaluates vulnerabilities in legacy cryptographic algorithms, and identifies key strategies for mitigating risks associated with quantum computing. The proposed framework includes a multi-faceted approach, encompassing the evaluation and selection of PQC algorithms, developing a phased transition plan, and establishing governance structures to ensure the long-term viability of quantum-resistant cryptographic infrastructure. Additionally, the paper underscores the importance of collaboration among business leaders, governmental bodies, and educational institutions to promote knowledge sharing and accelerate the adoption of PQC standards. By proactively addressing the challenges of transitioning to PQC, organizations can enhance the resilience of critical infrastructure, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive data in the face of advancing quantum computing capabilities.},

  abstract = {The shift from electronic identification to digital identity is indicative of a broader evolution towards datafication of identity at large. As digital identity emerges from the fringes of technical challenges towards the legal and socio-technical, pre-existing ideologies on the reform of digital identity re-emerge with a newfound enthusiasm. Self-sovereign identity is one representative example of this trend. This paper sets out to uncover the principles, technological design ideas, and underlying guiding ideologies that are attached to self-sovereign identity infrastructures, carrying the promise of user-centricity, self-sovereignty, and individual empowerment. Considering the flourishing of digital identity markets, and the subsequent institutional interest on a European level in the techno-social promises that this identity architecture carries, this paper explores how the implementation of EU-wide self-sovereign identity shifts the already existing historical power balances in the construction of identity infrastructures. In this contribution, we argue that the European-wide adoption of self-sovereign ideals in identity construction does not address the shortcomings that identity and identification have historically faced and that instead of citizen empowerment, it puts individuals (a category broader than citizens) in a rather vulnerabilized position.},

The behavioral-science paradigm seeks to develop and verify theories that explain or predict human or organizational behavior. The design-science paradigm seeks to extend the boundaries of human and organizational capabilities by creating new and innovative artifacts. Both paradigms are foundational to the IS discipline, positioned as it is at the confluence of people, organizations, and technology. Our objective is to describe the performance of design-science research in Information Systems via a concise conceptual framework and clear guidelines for understanding, executing, and evaluating the research. In the design-science paradigm, knowledge and understanding of a problem domain and its solution are achieved in the building and application of the designed artifact. Three recent exemplars in the research literature are used to demonstrate the application of these guidelines. We conclude with an analysis of the challenges of performing high-quality design-science research in the context of the broader IS community.},

The Rigor Cycle provides grounding theories and methods along with domain experience and expertise from the foundations knowledge base into the research and adds the new knowledge generated by the research to the growing knowledge base. The central Design Cycle sup- ports a tighter loop of research activity for the construction and evaluation of design artifacts and processes.

  abstract = {We are developing a transcontinental Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) stack that provides security against quantum attacks, by using post quantum cryptography (PQC). SSI is a concept and initiative to provide individuals and entities digital credentials which they can control and trust. Our project aims to secure the accessibility of digital credentials by following European (eIDAS, EBSI) and worldwide (W3C, OpenID) standards and implementing a hybrid post quantum cryptographic library.SSI solutions are at their core about sovereignty over personal identity data. These technologies have not yet seen wide adoption. To help the improvements in data security and privacy to be felt widely in society, these tools need wider adoption, which in turn requires them being more mature. We are increasing the maturity of SSI systems in two ways: making them secure against quantum attacks and fostering interoperability between credentials in the EU and US.Current SSI systems use standard cryptography, which is not secure against attacks by quantum computers. For these tools to be future-proof and truly secure, this shortcoming must be addressed. Luckily, cryptographic algorithms thought to be secure against quantum computers already exist and have recently been standardized by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). These new algorithms (often called Post-Quantum Cryptography or PQC) should also be used in SSI systems, and exactly this is a core result of our project.The new standards were very recently published (August 13th, 2024), and the algorithms have not yet been tested widely in the real world. As such, they need to start being implemented and tested right away. This presents an issue: how can we make SSI tools secure in the interim? A solution is hybrid cryptography, which uses PQC and classical cryptography in parallel. The security of hybrid systems is backed by time-tested algorithms and is also secure against future threats from quantum computers. Our project is incorporating PQC into SSI systems in a hybrid form.The hybrid cryptographic scheme that we are developing will use classical cryptography and a PQC algorithm. By classical we mean the commonly implemented digital signature schemes based on RSA or elliptic curves. The PQC digital signature algorithm that is being implemented in our project is ML-DSA (DILITHIUM). The security behind this new algorithm is based on what is known as lattice-based hardness problems and is thought to be secure against quantum computing algorithms. The implementation of this hybrid scheme is novel and impactful on the future usage of digital credentials.Our project has three main objectives: The implementation of an open-source SSI stack, hybrid post-quantum cryptographic protocol, and the interoperability of EU-US credentials and decentralized identities. Each one of these objectives promotes the core principles of decentralized identity, privacy, sustainable internet, and a human-centric future. The improvement of online privacy and security is especially contingent upon post-quantum cryptography as this will secure the identities of individuals against the quantum computing attacks of the future. Self-sovereign identity provides a decentralized and user-controlled digital credential technology. Interoperability across borders makes SSI truly decentralized. Together these three objectives help build identity technologies that are secure, private, future-proof and decentralized.},

  abstract = {Self-sovereignty can be defined as having control over the specifics of your own identity. ‘Self-sovereign identity (SSI)’ solutions aim to give users the ability to manage their identity without the need for central authorities or intermediaries. One of the key technologies commonly used to implement SSI is decentralized ledger technology, such as blockchain. It is immutable and distributed ledger capabilities provide a robust foundation for identity verification, authentication, and data sharing. Through the use of cryptographic mechanisms and digital signatures, users can maintain ownership of their identity attributes and selectively disclose information as needed. The term ‘identity management system (IDMS)’ describes the procedure for identifying and authorizing users or persons to access corporate systems and services. Single points of failure cannot be reduced by conventional identity management and authentication systems because they rely so largely on a reliable central authority. In recent years, the field of IDMS has paid a lot of attention to Blockchain (BC) technology, which functions as a decentralized and distributed public ledger in a peer-to-peer (P2P) network. Overall, the survey provides valuable insights into the implementation of a blockchain-based SSI system. It contributes to the growing body of knowledge in the field of identity management and showcases the promising potential of blockchain technology in redefining the way we manage digital identities.},

This study assesses the effectiveness of these techniques in mitigating cyber risks, explores their implementation challenges, and highlights existing research gaps. The findings indicate that AI-powered solutions significantly enhance real-time threat detection and response capabilities in maritime networks, yet issues such as data scarcity, regulatory constraints, and adversarial attacks on AI models remain unresolved. Future research directions should focus on integrating AI with blockchain, federated learning, and quantum cryptographic techniques to strengthen maritime cybersecurity frameworks.},

  abstract = {This article presents an innovative project for a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) infrastructure. Focusing on security and reliability, the proposed architecture: (1) employs post-quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms for long-term security, even against attackers with access to cryptographically-relevant quantum computers; (2) can be integrated with a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) to safeguard the confidentiality of transaction contents as they are processed by third-parties; and (3) uses Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) to promote a high level of transparency and tamper resistance for all transactions registered in the system. Besides providing a theoretical discussion on the benefits of this architecture, we experimentally evaluate its components. Namely, as PQC algorithms, we consider three signature schemes being standardized by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), CRYSTALS-Dilithium, Falcon, and SPHINCS+. Those algorithms are integrated into the Hyperledger Besu (DLT) and executed both inside and outside an Intel SGX TEE environment. According to our results, CRYSTALS-Dilithium-2 combined with classical secp256k1 signatures leads to the shortest execution times when signing blocks in the DLT, reaching 1.68ms without the TEE, and 2.09ms with TEE. The same combination also displays the best results for signature verifications, achieving 0.5ms without a TEE and 1.98ms with a TEE. We also describe the main aspects of the evaluation methodology and the next steps in validating the proposed infrastructure. The conclusions drawn from our experiments is that the combination of PQC and TEE promises highly secure and effective DLT-based CBDC scenarios, ready to face the challenges of the digital financial future and potential quantum threats.},

  abstract = {Digital Twins (DT) virtually model cyber-physical objects via sensory inputs by simulating or monitoring their behavior. Therefore, DTs usually harbor vast quantities of Internet of Things (IoT) components (e.g., sensors) that gather, process, and offload sensitive information (e.g., healthcare) to the cloud. It is imperative to ensure the trustworthiness of such sensitive information with long-term and compromise-resilient security guarantees. Digital signatures provide scalable authentication and integrity with non-repudiation and are vital tools for DTs. Post-quantum cryptography (PQC) and forward-secure signatures are two fundamental tools to offer long-term security and breach resiliency. However, NIST-PQC signature standards are exorbitantly costly for embedded DT components and are infeasible when forward-security is also considered. Moreover, NIST-PQC signatures do not admit aggregation, which is a highly desirable feature to mitigate the heavy storage and transmission burden in DTs. Finally, NIST recommends hybrid PQ solutions to enable cryptographic agility and transitional security. Yet, there is a significant gap in the state of the art in the achievement of all these advanced features simultaneously. Therefore, there is a significant need for lightweight digital signatures that offer compromise resiliency and compactness while permitting transitional security into the PQ era for DTs.                            We create a series of highly lightweight digital signatures called Hardware-ASisted Efficient Signature (               HASES               ) that meets the above requirements. The core of               HASES               ~is a hardware-assisted cryptographic commitment construct oracle (               CCO               ) that permits verifiers to obtain expensive commitments without signer interaction. We created three               HASES               ~schemes:               PQ-HASES               ~is a forward-secure PQ signature,               LA-HASES               ~is an efficient aggregate Elliptic-Curve signature, and               HY-HASES               ~is a novel hybrid scheme that combines               PQ-HASES               ~and               LA-HASES               ~with novel strong nesting and sequential aggregation.               HASES               ~does not require a secure-hardware on the signer. We prove that               HASES               ~schemes are secure and implemented them on commodity hardware and and 8-bit AVR ATmega2560. Our experiments confirm that               PQ-HASES               ~and               LA-HASES               ~are two magnitudes of times more signer efficient than their PQ and conventional-secure counterparts, respectively.               HY-HASES               ~outperforms NIST PQC and conventional signature combinations, offering a standard-compliant transitional solution for emerging DTs. We open-source               HASES               ~schemes for public-testing and adaptation.},

  abstract = {Summary             Cyber‐attacks are considered the most significant threat to organizations from different sectors, including critical infrastructure. Access to critical assets, including industrial control systems, and control over their usage is one of the security approaches implemented to protect those systems from unauthorized access. However, existing implementations do not support the enforcement of fine‐grained authorization policies and do not provide continuous control over data access. Furthermore, existing implementations of the access control paradigm require policy‐makers to perform a manual update of policies that do not consider information about potential or ongoing cyber attacks. In this work, we propose a framework that enables continuous control on the execution of access rights in the industrial domain. Furthermore, the framework relies on cyber incident information shared by trusted entities. This information is used for updating security policies in order to prevent possible incidents within the smart factory infrastructure. We also provide experimental results that show the operability and the efficiency of the proposed framework.},

DS is of importance in a discipline oriented to the creation of successful artifacts. Several researchers have pioneered DS research in IS, yet over the past 15 years, little DS research has been done within the discipline. The lack of a methodology to serve as a commonly accepted framework for DS research and of a template for its presentation may have contributed to its slow adoption. The design science research methodology (DSRM) presented here incorporates principles, practices, and procedures required to carry out such research and meets three objectives: it is consistent with prior literature, it provides a nominal process model for doing DS research, and it provides a mental model for presenting and evaluating DS research in IS. The DS process includes six steps: problem identification and motivation, definition of the objectives for a solution, design and development, demonstration, evaluation, and communication. We demonstrate and evaluate the methodology by presenting four case studies in terms of the DSRM, including cases that present the design of a database to support health assessment methods, a software reuse measure, an Internet video telephony application, and an IS planning method. The designed methodology effectively satisfies the three objectives and has the potential to help aid the acceptance of DS research in the IS discipline.},

  abstract = {The first cryptocurrency was invented in 2008/09, but the Blockchain-Web3 concept is still in its infancy, and the cyber risk is constantly changing. Cybersecurity should also be adapting to these changes to ensure security of personal data and continuation of operations. This article starts with a comparison of existing cybersecurity standards and regulations from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO)—ISO27001, followed by a discussion on more specific and recent standards and regulations, such as the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures and the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (CPMI-IOSCO), and more general cryptography (and post-quantum cryptography), in the context of cybersecurity. These topics are followed up by a review of recent technical reports on cyber risk/security and a discussion on cloud security questions. Comparison of Blockchain cyber risk is also performed on the recent EU standards on cyber security, including European Cybersecurity Certification Scheme (EUCS)—cloud, and US standards—The National Vulnerability Database (NVD) Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The study includes a review of Blockchain endpoint security, and new technologies e.g., IoT. The research methodology applied is a review and case study analysing secondary data on cybersecurity. The research significance is the integration of knowledge from the United States (US), the European Union (EU), the United Kingdom (UK), and international standards and frameworks on cybersecurity that can be alighted to new Blockchain projects. The results show that cybersecurity standards are not designed in close cooperation between the two major western blocks: US and EU. In addition, while the US is still leading in this area, the security standards for cryptocurrencies, internet-of-things, and blockchain technologies have not evolved as fast as the technologies have. The key finding from this study is that although the crypto-market has grown into a multi-trillion industry, the crypto-market has also lost over 70\% since its peak, causing significant financial loss for individuals and cooperation’s. Despite this significant impact to individuals and society, cybersecurity standards and financial governance regulations are still in their infancy, specifically in the UK.},

Traditional centralized identity systems are increasingly inadequate due to their vulnerabilities, such as single points of failure, scalability issues, and limited user control over data. This study explores a decentralized identity management model leveraging the IOTA Tangle, a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)-based distributed ledger technology, to address these challenges. By integrating Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), Verifiable Credentials (VCs), and IOTA-specific technologies like IOTA Identity, IOTA Streams, and IOTA Stronghold, we propose a proof-of-concept framework that enhances security, scalability, and privacy in IoT ecosystems. Our implementation on resource-constrained IoT devices demonstrates the feasibility of this approach, highlighting significant improvements in transaction efficiency, real-time data exchange, and cryptographic key management. Furthermore, this research aligns with Web 3.0 principles, emphasizing decentralization, user autonomy, and data sovereignty. The findings suggest that IOTA-based solutions can effectively advance secure and user-centric identity management in IoT, paving the way for broader applications in various domains, including smart cities and healthcare.},

  abstract = {Manufacturing facilities, transportation networks, energy distribution networks, and power plants are all examples of Critical Infrastructure (CI) that modern communities depend on to provide goods and services. Due to their size, complexity, and unique features, these CIs frequently require the assistance of Industrial Automation and Control Systems (IACS). IACS manages assets and administers day-to-day activities. With additional processes and networked monitoring and controlling devices, the attack surface of the underlying CIs grows in these increasingly complex IACS.~ To establish and discern the correlation between worldwide concerns concerning Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) and cybersecurity. In order to support the economy and security interests, it is necessary to guarantee that systems, goods, and services are sufficiently reliable and resilient. This circumstance necessitates the development of new ways based on advanced data analytics techniques that can extract insights from the CI to enhance Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) frameworks. This paper introduces a proposed IAM-based audit framework that integrates capabilities for forensic investigation and audit compliance through effective architectural functions within security systems. The framework incorporates algorithms such as data acquisition and domain processors. The data acquisition algorithm processes a substantial dataset, comprising organized data for cloud identity and access management systems, including AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud datasets. It employs a DMA process to evaluate system performance metrics such as perceived data rate, ingested rate, and consumed rate. Afterward, the domain processor computes the data event by utilizing the determined ingested event as input. By changing the number of nodes or clients from 3 to 10, the suggested framework can help find the biggest event that is ingested, the longest time it takes to compute, and the shortest time it takes to compute. This article also introduces the Interruption and Abnormality-based Identification System (IAIS), a novel architecture designed to enhance Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) globally. By integrating forensic readiness and compliance auditing, IAIS addresses challenges in post-incident investigation and real-time monitoring. Its cloud-native design ensures scalability, making it a vital tool for safeguarding critical systems against evolving cyber threats Furthermore, this experimental evaluation also demonstrated the utility of the suggested framework in detecting common sequences of attacks.},

While a number of high-level requirements (e.g., related to privacy and security) are established to make interoperability among Member States possible, the eIDAS regulation does not explicitly specify the technologies that can be adopted during the development phase to meet the requirements as mentioned earlier. To the best of our knowledge, there is no work available in the literature investigating the technological trends within the notified eIDAS electronic identity schemes used by Member States. To fill this gap, this paper analyzes how the different technological trends of notified schemes satisfy the requirements of the eIDAS regulation. To do this, we define a set of research questions that allow us to investigate the correlations between different design dimensions such as security, privacy, and usability. Based on these findings, we provide a set of lessons learned that would be valuable to the security community, as they can provide useful insights on how to more efficiently protect interoperable national digital identities. Furthermore, we provide a brief overview regarding the new eIDAS regulation (eIDAS 2.0) that aims to provide a more privacy-preserving electronic identity solution by moving from a centralized approach to a decentralized one.},

  abstract = {The next-generation “Industrial Internet of Things” (IIoT) will support “Machine-to-Machine” (M2M) communications for smart Cyber-Physical-Systems and Industry 4.0, and require guaranteed cyber-security. This paper explores hardware-enforced cyber-security for critical infrastructures. It examines a quantum-safe “Software-Defined-Deterministic IIoT” (SDD-IIoT), with a new forwarding-plane (sub-layer-3a) for deterministic M2M traffic flows. A “Software-Defined Networking” (SDN) control plane controls many “Software-Defined-Deterministic Wide-Area Networks” (SDD-WANs), realized with FPGAs. The SDN control plane provides an “Admission-Control/Access-Control” system for network-bandwidth, using collaborating Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based “Zero Trust Architectures” (ZTAs). Hardware-enforced access-control eliminates all congestion, BufferBloat, and DoS/DDoS attacks, significantly reduces buffer-sizes, and supports ultra-reliable-low-latency communications in the forwarding-plane. The forwarding-plane can: (i) Encrypt/Authenticate M2M flows using quantum-safe ciphers, to withstand attacks by Quantum Computers; (ii) Implement “guaranteed intrusion detection systems” in FPGAs, to detect cyber-attacks embedded within billions of IIoT packets; (iii) Provide guaranteed immunity to external cyber-attacks, and exceptionally strong immunity to internal cyber-attacks; (iv) Save USD 100s of billions annually by exploiting FPGAs; and (v) Enable hybrid Classical-Quantum networks, by integrating a “quantum key distribution” (QKD) network with a classical forwarding plane with exceptionally strong cyber-security, determined by the computational hardness of cracking Symmetric Key Cryptography. Extensive experimental results for an SDD-WAN over the European Union are reported.},

  abstract = {The performance of virtual machines (VMs) has an important role in the overall effectiveness of deployed IT solutions. Many organizations leverage VMs which run in a cloud environment instead of traditional on-premises machines. It is therefore important to select the most suitable cloud provider according to the performance of the VM. This study aims to compare the performance of VMs running under Microsoft, Amazon and Google, the three largest available cloud service providers who offer Infrastructure-as-a-Service.Linux Ubuntu 20.04 LTS distribution was deployed as the reference operating system and comparisons were accomplished with the Phoronix Test Suite, which offers hundreds of benchmarking tests. For the aims of the study, 13 relevant tests covering the major areas of VMs were selected.The study’s analysis revealed that the VM running at Amazon Web Services (AWS) exceeded the performance of machines at Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The study’s comparison showed that the AWS platform achieved a final score 87\% and Microsoft Azure and GCP both achieved 77\%.The performance of the VM is a factor that organizations might consider when they select a suitable cloud provider. This study provides an insight into high-performance cloud VMs and the methods of comparing their performance. The study delivers a significant contribution in comparing the performance of publicly accessible cloud VMs since no studies to date have been published on this topic.},
