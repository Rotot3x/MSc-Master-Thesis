  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               The rapid expansion of Internet of Things applications in healthcare has created new opportunities for improving patient care through real-time monitoring and data sharing. However, this growth also introduces significant challenges related to data security, privacy, and system efficiency, especially for devices with limited processing power and energy resources. To address these issues, this study introduces a blockchain-based lightweight hashing system specifically designed for healthcare environments with resource-constrained devices. The goal is to ensure secure, efficient, and scalable handling of sensitive medical data without overwhelming the capabilities of connected devices.                                         Results               The proposed system combines a collision-resistant, lightweight hash function with blockchain technology to enhance data integrity, authentication, and privacy. The hash function minimizes computational demands, making it ideal for wearable and embedded healthcare devices. Blockchain integration enables decentralized data management, preventing unauthorized access and tampering. The system generates unique, immutable patient identifiers and protects electronic health information from common security threats, including collision attacks, Sybil attacks, and cryptographic analysis. Simulation results show improved computational efficiency, lower latency, and effective handling of high transaction volumes with minimal resource usage.                                         Conclusions               This research presents a secure and efficient framework for managing medical data in healthcare Internet of Things applications. By leveraging lightweight cryptographic techniques and decentralized data structures, the system addresses key limitations in current solutions while supporting scalability and real-world deployment. Potential applications include secure patient monitoring, real-time sharing of health data, and decentralized management of medical records. The proposed approach provides a foundation for future advancements in digital healthcare systems, particularly in remote care, emergency response, and wearable health technologies.},

  abstract = {The introduction of mobile banking is essential in today’s financial sector, where technological innovation plays a critical role. To remain competitive in the current market, businesses must analyze client attitudes and perspectives, as these influence long-term demand and overall profitability. While previous studies have explored general adoption behaviors, limited research has examined how individual factors such as social influence, lifestyle compatibility, financial technology self-efficacy, and perceived usage cost affect mobile banking adoption among specific generational cohorts. This study addresses that gap by offering insights into these variables, contributing to the growing literature on mobile banking adoption, and presenting actionable recommendations for financial institutions targeting younger market segments. Using a structured questionnaire survey, data were collected from both users and non-users of mobile banking among the Gen Z population in the United States. The regression model significantly predicts mobile banking adoption, with an intercept of −0.548 (p~{$<~$}0.001). Among the independent variables, perceived cost of usage has the strongest positive effect on adoption (B=0.857, β=0.722, p~{$<~$}0.001), suggesting that adoption increases when mobile banking is perceived as more affordable. Social influence also has a significant positive impact (B=0.642, β=0.643, p~{$<~$}0.001), indicating that peer influence is a central driver of adoption decisions. However, self-efficacy shows a significant negative relationship (B=−0.343, β=−0.339, p~{$<~$}0.001), and lifestyle compatibility was found to be statistically insignificant (p=0.615). These findings suggest that reducing perceived costs, through lower fees, data bundling, or clearer communication about affordability, can directly enhance adoption among Gen Z consumers. Furthermore, leveraging peer influence via referral rewards, Partnerships with influencers, and in-app social features can increase user adoption. Since digital self-efficacy presents a barrier for some, banks should prioritize simplifying user interfaces and offering guided assistance, such as tutorials or chat-based support. Future research may employ longitudinal designs or analyze real-life transaction data for a more objective understanding of behavior. Additional variables like trust, perceived risk, and regulatory policies, not included in this study, should be integrated into future models to offer a more comprehensive analysis.},

The protocol introduces challenge–response–pair mechanisms enabling the generation, distribution, and verification of cryptographic public–private key pairs in a distributed network with multi-factor authentication, tokens, and template-less biometry. While protocols using generic digital signature algorithms are proposed, the focus of the experimental work was to implement a solution based on Crystals-Dilithium, a post-quantum cryptographic algorithm under standardization. Crystals-Dilithium generates public keys consisting of two interrelated parts, a matrix generating seed, and a vector computed from the matrix and two randomly picked vectors forming the secret key. We show how such a split of the public keys lends itself to a two-way authentication of both the trusted entity and the users.},

  abstract = {The convergence of decentralized artificial intelligence (DAI), blockchain technology, and smart contracts is reshaping the design and governance of intelligent systems. As these technologies rapidly evolve, addressing privacy within their architecture, usage models, and associated risks has become increasingly critical. This systematic literature review examines architectural patterns, governance frameworks, real-world applications, and persistent challenges in DAI systems. It identifies prevailing designs such as federated learning integrated with consensus protocols, smart contract-based incentive mechanisms, and decentralized verification methods. Drawing from a diverse body of recent literature, the review highlights implementations across sectors, including healthcare, finance, IoT, autonomous systems, and intelligent infrastructure, each demonstrating significant contributions to privacy, security, and collaborative innovation. Despite these advancements, DAI systems face ongoing obstacles such as scalability limitations, privacy trade-offs, and difficulties with regulatory compliance. The review emphasizes the need for integrative governance approaches that balance transparency, accountability, incentive alignment, and ethical oversight. These elements are proposed as co-evolving pillars essential to establishing trustworthiness in decentralized AI ecosystems. This work offers a comprehensive review for understanding the current landscape and guiding the development of responsible and effective DAI systems in the Web3 era.},

  abstract = {The increasing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI)‐driven unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in military, commercial, and surveillance operations has introduced significant security challenges, including cyber threats, adversarial AI attacks, and communication vulnerabilities. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the key security threats and challenges faced by AI‐powered UAVs, such as unauthorized access, GPS spoofing, adversarial manipulations, and UAV hijacking. We analyze advanced solutions including blockchain‐secured UAV networks, post‐quantum cryptography (PQC), adversarial AI training, self‐healing AI models, and multi‐factor authentication (MFA), which collectively strengthen UAV cybersecurity defenses. Our findings highlight the critical role of emerging technologies, including self‐adaptive AI‐driven UAVs capable of detecting and learning from novel cyber threats autonomously. We also discuss the integration of 6\,G‐powered communication networks for secure and ultra‐fast encrypted transmissions, as well as Edge AI computing that enables real‐time, onboard threat detection without cloud dependency. Furthermore, decentralized intelligence models and blockchain‐based authentication are shown to enhance security in UAV swarms by preventing unauthorized infiltration. Overall, this review emphasizes the necessity of multilayered security frameworks that combine AI techniques, cryptographic measures, and decentralized swarm protection to ensure resilient, autonomous, and secure UAV operations in complex and high‐risk environments.},

  abstract = {The concept of Self-Sovereign Identity insert ignore into journalissuearticles values(SSI);, where we can store our personal information and documents securely, as proven by the relevant authorities, and share them with the people we want, has become widespread as the personal secure data storage method that we need most in recent years. We have to physically carry our evidence-based identities obtained from events or institutions. Keeping our identity, age, health status, educational status, and many other personal data inaccessible to others and without questioning the accuracy when we share them also restricts their use in different areas. Sharing the data depending on the consent of the people and presenting the data accurately and reliably has become one of our most important needs today. With the concept of SSI, it has become possible for us to save our data as distributed, inaccessible, unalterable, and incorruptible. In addition, with the possibility of public access to the information with the consent of the people, it is possible to instantly share the information with the people/institutions we want. This study will explain mobile application processes created on SSI infrastructure. It will be possible to add different institutions to the developed system and to identify the added institutions to the users. The identities given by the institutions will be able to be proven by different institutions. Thus, the operating structure of this system will be transferred with a verifiable and reliable infrastructure. This study, it is aimed to contribute to the general operating processes of those who will develop the SSI infrastructure. To develop such a system, it has been determined that ACA-Py is the most suitable infrastructure framework. After comparing the efficacy of Askar and Indy for the selection of the wallet to be used, it was determined that the Askar wallet would be used in the system.},

  abstract = {Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) promises information-theoretic security, yet integrating QKD into existing protocols like TLS remains challenging due to its fundamentally different operational model. In this paper, we propose a hybrid QKD-KEM protocol with two distinct integration approaches: a client-initiated flow compatible with both ETSI 004 and 014 specifications, and a server-initiated flow similar to existing work but limited to stateless ETSI 014 APIs. Unlike previous implementations, our work specifically addresses the integration of stateful QKD key exchange protocols (ETSI 004) which is essential for production QKD networks but has remained largely unexplored. By adapting OpenSSL's provider infrastructure to accommodate QKD's pre-distributed key model, we maintain compatibility with current TLS implementations while offering dual layers of security. Performance evaluations demonstrate the feasibility of our hybrid scheme with acceptable overhead, showing that robust security against quantum threats is achievable while addressing the unique requirements of different QKD API specifications.},

  abstract = {Creating search strategies for systematic reviews, finding the best balance between sensitivity and specificity, and translating search strategies between databases is challenging. Several methods describe standards for systematic search strategies, but a consistent approach for creating an exhaustive search strategy has not yet been fully described in enough detail to be fully replicable. The authors have established a method that describes step by step the process of developing a systematic search strategy as needed in the systematic review. This method describes how single-line search strategies can be prepared in a text document by typing search syntax (such as field codes, parentheses, and Boolean operators) before copying and pasting search terms (keywords and free-text synonyms) that are found in the thesaurus. To help ensure term completeness, we developed a novel optimization technique that is mainly based on comparing the results retrieved by thesaurus terms with those retrieved by the free-text search words to identify potentially relevant candidate search terms. Macros in Microsoft Word have been developed to convert syntaxes between databases and interfaces almost automatically. This method helps information specialists in developing librarian-mediated searches for systematic reviews as well as medical and health care practitioners who are searching for evidence to answer clinical questions. The described method can be used to create complex and comprehensive search strategies for different databases and interfaces, such as those that are needed when searching for relevant references for systematic reviews, and will assist both information specialists and practitioners when they are searching the biomedical literature.},

  abstract = {The “standing on the shoulders of giants” metaphor is often used to acknowledge the work of others when undertaking research and, in particular, stresses the importance of literature reviews in scientific inquiry. Though the significance of literature reviews has never been in doubt, researchers, especially novice researchers, still struggle with developing effective strategies for reviewing literature. An important reason for this difficulty is the rapidly increasing number of potentially relevant publications—not all of which necessarily add value to a literature review. As such, avoiding standing on the shoulders of dwarfs literature search emerges as a major issue in crafting an effective literature review. In this paper, we discuss challenges of literature searches in the increasingly dynamic context of information systems (IS) research and make recommendations for how to deal with them. We present practical guidelines and a checklist to help researchers with planning and organizing their literature searches. Download: http://aisel.aisnet.org/cais/vol37/iss1/9/},

  abstract = {The integration of electric vehicles (EVs) into smart grids (SGs) is reshaping both energy systems and mobility infrastructures. This review presents a comprehensive and cross-disciplinary synthesis of current technologies, methodologies, and challenges associated with EV–SG interaction. Unlike prior reviews that address these aspects in isolation, this work uniquely connects three critical pillars: (i) the evolution of energy storage technologies, including lithium-ion, second-life, and hybrid systems; (ii) optimisation and predictive control techniques using artificial intelligence (AI) for real-time energy management and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) coordination; and (iii) cybersecurity risks and post-quantum solutions required to safeguard increasingly decentralised and data-intensive grid environments. The novelty of this review lies in its integrated perspective, highlighting how emerging innovations, such as federated AI models, blockchain-secured V2G transactions, digital twin simulations, and quantum-safe cryptography, are converging to overcome existing limitations in scalability, resilience, and interoperability. Furthermore, we identify underexplored research gaps, such as standardisation of bidirectional communication protocols, regulatory inertia in V2G market participation, and the lack of unified privacy-preserving data architectures. By mapping current advancements and outlining a strategic research roadmap, this article provides a forward-looking foundation for the development of secure, flexible, and grid-responsive EV ecosystems. The findings support policymakers, engineers, and researchers in advancing the technical and regulatory landscape necessary to scale EV–SG integration within sustainable smart cities.},

This survey maps the space from foundations to practice. We first develop a taxonomy across lattice-, code-, hash-, multivariate-, isogeny-, and MPC-in-the-Head families, summarizing security assumptions, cryptanalysis, and standardization status. We then compare performance and communication costs using representative, implementation-grounded measurements, and review hardware acceleration (AVX2, FPGA/ASIC) and implementation security with a focus on side-channel resistance. Building upward, we examine protocol integration (TLS, DNSSEC), PKI and certificate hygiene, and deployment in constrained and high-assurance environments (IoT, cloud, finance, blockchain). We also discuss complementarity with quantum technologies (QKD, QRNGs) and the limits of near-term quantum computing. Throughout, we emphasize crypto-agility, hybrid migration, and evidence-based guidance for operators. We conclude with open problems spanning parameter agility, leakage-resilient implementations, and domain-specific rollout playbooks. This survey aims to be a practical reference for researchers and practitioners planning quantum-safe systems, bridging standards, engineering, and operations.},

  abstract = {Summary                            Microservices architecture and continuous software engineering are becoming popular approaches for developing and operating software products. The enabling feature of this success is the independence of the execution environments hosting microservices: by insulating failures and versioning in specific microservices, a complex application benefits of high availability at runtime and agility at development time. However, execution independence does not mean functional independence. Microservices need to interact among them to fulfill a common goal of an application. The unavailability of a microservice may seriously impact other dependent microservices, limiting continuity. To address this new kind of problem in microservices architecture, we argue the necessity of a synchronization mechanism able to support microservices coordination according to their running states: dependent microservices should wait for unready ones to avoid useless and faulty interactions. In this article, we propose a new framework,               Synchronizer               , able to support synchronization among microservices by exploiting distributed registries for collecting health/state information about deployed containers and hosted microservices. It has been implemented for the OpenShift platform and validated in different use cases: for example, for coordinating applications bootstrap and for programming scripts of continuous deployment orchestrators, such as Jenkins. In both cases,               Synchronizer               worked as expected and showed the positive effects of synchronization, giving us a valuable feedback about the possibility of further extending its application and of integrating the feature in existing microservices frameworks (eg, services mesh).},

Although numerous individual solutions exist, comprehensive frameworks that effectively combine advanced technologies to address evolving threats are lacking. This paper presents the Integrated Adaptive Security Framework for IoT (IASF-IoT), which integrates artificial intelligence, blockchain technology, and quantum-resistant cryptography into a unified solution tailored for IoT environments. Central to the framework is an adaptive AI-driven security orchestration mechanism, complemented by blockchain-based identity management, lightweight quantum-resistant protocols, and Digital Twins to predict and proactively mitigate threats. A theoretical performance model and large-scale simulation involving 1000 heterogeneous IoT devices were used to evaluate the framework. Results showed that IASF-IoT achieved detection accuracy between 85\% and 99\%, with simulated energy consumption remaining below 1.5 mAh per day and response times averaging around 2 s. These findings suggest that the framework offers strong potential for scalable, low-overhead security in resource-constrained IoT environments.},

  abstract = {In this work, we present a set of comprehensive experimental studies on Hyperledger Besu in private blockchain. We aim to exhibit its performance characteristics in terms of transaction throughput, latency, resource utilization, and scalability, from the application perspective by adding a load balancer middleware. We have carefully designed a set of comparative experiments and judiciously selected typical parameters, including transaction send rate, network size, node flavor, load balancing, consensus, and block time. In particular, three proof of authority consensus algorithms, Clique, IBFT 2.0, and QBFT, are investigated. Through extensive experimental evaluations using the Hyperledger Caliper benchmark tool, we analyze how these parameters impact the performance of a private Besu blockchain. Our studies reveal several interesting findings: 1) Blockchain parameters, e.g., block time and block size, are the most significant factors in determining Besu performance; 2) The performance of Besu is bottlenecked by transaction execution and blockchain state updates, which are determined by parameters such as node computation power, transaction complexity, and load balancing; 3) A Besu network with QBFT consensus can scale up to 14 validators without noticeable performance loss. Our findings shed some light on further performance improvement of Hyperledger Besu. The identified bottlenecks and root cause analysis provide insightful suggestions for blockchain practitioners to build performant enterprise applications.},

  abstract = {Blockchain technology has introduced new paradigms for identity management systems (IDMSs), enabling users to regain control over their identity data and reduce reliance on centralized authorities. In recent years, numerous blockchain-based IDMS solutions have emerged across both practical application domains and academic research. However, prior reviews often focus on single application areas, provide limited cross-domain comparison, and insufficiently address security challenges such as interoperability, revocation, and quantum resilience. This paper bridges these gaps by presenting the first comprehensive survey that examines IDMSs from three complementary perspectives: (i) historical evolution from centralized and federated models to blockchain-based decentralized architectures; (ii) a cross-domain taxonomy of blockchain-based IDMSs, encompassing both general-purpose designs and domain-specific implementations; and (iii) a security analysis of threats across the full identity lifecycle. Drawing on a systematic review of 47 studies published between 2019 and 2025 and conducted in accordance with the PRISMA methodology, the paper synthesizes academic research and real-world deployments to identify unresolved technical, economic, and social challenges, and to outline directions for future research. The findings aim to serve as a timely reference for both researchers and practitioners working toward secure, interoperable, and sustainable blockchain-based IDMSs.},

The utilisation of an identifier (e.g. username, email address and so on) and credential (e.g. password) still remains the most widely deployed user authentication process, even though such an authentication process is one of the major sources of security breaches. Moreover, in this traditional setting, the management and sharing of user identity information is cumbersome with limited user controls over their identity data. In recent times, SSI has emerged as a new mechanism for managing and exchanging identity information in a more user-centric and privacy-friendly way. There are many explorations of SSI in different application domains, however, its utility for the web mostly remains unexplored. In this work, we present SSI4Web, a framework for integrating Self-sovereign Identity (SSI) for providing web services in a secure passwordless manner with much more user control and greater flexibility. We provide its architecture, discuss its implementation details, sketch out its use-case with an analysis of its advantages and limitations.},

  abstract = {Interoperation for data sharing between permissioned blockchain networks relies on networks' abilities to independently authenticate requests and validate proofs accompanying the data; these typically contain digital signatures. This requires counterparty networks to know the identities and certification chains of each other's members, establishing a common trust basis rooted in identity. But permissioned networks are ad hoc consortia of existing organizations, whose network affiliations may not be well-known or well-established even though their individual identities are. In this paper, we describe an architecture and set of protocols for distributed identity management across permissioned blockchain networks to establish a trust basis for data sharing. Networks wishing to interoperate can associate with one or more distributed identity registries that maintain credentials on shared ledgers managed by groups of reputed identity providers. A network's participants possess self-sovereign decentralized identities (DIDs) on these registries and can obtain privacy-preserving verifiable membership credentials. During interoperation, networks can securely and dynamically discover each others' latest membership lists and members' credentials. We implement a solution based on Hyperledger Indy and Aries, and demonstrate its viability and usefulness by linking a trade finance network with a trade logistics network, both built on Hyperledger Fabric. We also analyze the extensibility, security, and trustworthiness of our system.},

However, the rapid advancement of AI technologies brings significant security and privacy challenges. Recent incidents highlight vulnerabilities in AI systems, such as data leakage and malicious code injection, leading to severe financial losses and privacy breaches. Although existing studies have discussed specific security threats, they often lack detailed granularity and cover a limited scope. In this survey, we fill this gap by systematically categorizing and analyzing the threats and countermeasures in AI systems, which span both the training and inference stages, encompass centralized and distributed settings, and address both conventional and foundation AI models. By reviewing existing literature, we aim to provide AI researchers and practitioners with a thorough understanding of system vulnerabilities and current countermeasures. We hope to inspire further research into robust solutions, ultimately contributing to the development of resilient AI technologies.},

  abstract = {Containerization significantly boosts cloud computing efficiency by reducing resource consumption, enhancing scalability, and simplifying orchestration. Yet, these same features introduce notable security vulnerabilities due to the shared Linux kernel and reduced isolation compared to traditional virtual machines (VMs). This architecture, while resource-efficient, increases susceptibility to software vulnerabilities, exposing containers to potential breaches; a single kernel vulnerability could compromise all containers on the same host. Existing academic research on container security is often theoretical and lacks empirical data on the nature of attacks, exploits, and vulnerabilities. Studies that do look at vulnerabilities often focus on specific types. This lack of detailed data and breadth hampers the development of effective mitigation strategies and restricts insights into the inherent weaknesses of containers. To address these gaps, our study introduces a novel taxonomy integrating academic knowledge with industry insights and real-world vulnerabilities, creating a comprehensive and actionable framework for container security. We analyzed over 200 container-related vulnerabilities, categorizing them into 47 exploit types across 11 distinct attack vectors. This taxonomy not only advances theoretical understanding but also facilitates the identification of vulnerabilities and the implementation of effective mitigation strategies in containerized environments. Our approach enhances the resilience of these environments by mapping vulnerabilities to their corresponding exploits and mitigation strategies, especially in complex, multi-tenant cloud settings. By providing actionable insights, our taxonomy helps practitioners enhance container security. Our findings have identified critical areas for further investigation, thereby laying a comprehensive foundation for future research and improving container security in cloud environments.},

  abstract = {Context: Software engineering researchers and practitioners rely on empirical evidence from the field. Thus, education of software engineers must include strong and applied education in empirical research methods. For most students, the master's thesis is the last, but also most applied form of this education in their studies. Problem: Especially thesis work in collaboration with industry requires that concerns of stakeholders from academia and practice are carefully balanced. It is possible, yet difficult to do high-impact empirical work within the timeframe of a typical thesis. In particular, if this research aims to provide practical value to industry, academic quality can suffer. Even though constructive research methods such as Design Science Research (DSR) exist, thesis projects repeatably struggle to apply them. Principle solution idea: DSR enables balancing such concerns by providing room both for knowledge questions and design work. Yet, only limited experience exists in our field on how to make this research method work within the context of a master's thesis. To enable running design science master's theses in collaboration with industry, we complement existing method descriptions and guidelines with our own experience and pragmatic advice to students, examiners, and supervisors in academia and industry. Method: This paper itself is based on DSR. Based on 12 design science theses over the last seven years, we collect common pitfalls and good practice from analysing the theses, the student-supervisor interaction, the supervisor-industry interaction, the examiner feedback, and, where available, reviewer comments on publications that are based on such theses. Results: We provide concrete advise for framing research questions, structuring a report, as well as for planning and conducting empirical work with practitioners.},

Blockchain-based smart contracts offer reliability, transparency, and efficiency in healthcare services, making them a focal point of many studies. However, challenges such as scalability, regulatory compliance, and interoperability continue to limit their widespread adoption. This study conducts a comprehensive literature review to assess blockchain-driven health data management, focusing on the classification of blockchain-based smart contracts in health policy and the health protocols and standards applicable to blockchain-based smart contracts. This review includes 80 core studies published between 2019 and 2025, identified through searches in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science using the PRISMA method. Risk of bias and methodological quality were assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute tool. The findings highlight the potential of blockchain-enabled smart contracts in health policy management, emphasizing their advantages, limitations, and implementation challenges. Additionally, the research underscores their transformative impact on digital health policies in ensuring data integrity, enhancing patient autonomy, and fostering a more resilient healthcare ecosystem. Recent advancements in quantum technologies are also considered as they present both novel opportunities and emerging threats to the future security and design of healthcare blockchain systems.},

The current research takes as its hypothesis that the InfraGuard Cybersecurity Framework—a capability model that measures the maturity of cyber resilience through three functional pillars, Cyber as a Shield, Cyber as a Space, and Cyber as a Sword—is an implementable and understandable means to proceed with. The model treats the significant aspects of situational awareness, active defense, risk management, and recovery from incidents and is measured using globally standardized maturity models like ISO/IEC 15504, NIST CSF, and COBIT. The contributions include multidimensional measurements of resilience, a scored scale of capability (0–5), and domain-based classification enabling organizations to assess and enhance their cybersecurity situation in a formalized manner. The framework’s applicability is illustrated in three exploratory settings of power grids, healthcare systems, and airports, each constituting various levels of maturity in resilience. This study provides down-to-earth recommendations to policymakers through the translation of the attributes of resilience into concrete assessment indicators, promoting policymaking, investment planning, and global cyber defense collaboration.},

Such an understanding must tie together natural laws governing IT systems with natural laws governing the environments in which they operate. This paper presents a two dimensional framework for research in information technology. The first dimension is based on broad types of design and natural science research activities: build, evaluate, theorize, and justify. The second dimension is based on broad types of outputs produced by design research: representational constructs, models, methods, and instantiations.

  abstract = {Context: Crypto-agility, a name that stems from agile methodologies for software development, means the ability to modify quickly and securely cryptographic algorithms in the event of a compromise. The advent of quantum computing poses existential threats to current cryptography, having the power to breach current cryptography systems. Objective: We investigated whether and to what extent agile practices for software development are suited to support crypto-agility, or not. In particular, we discuss their usefulness in the context of substituting current algorithms with quantum-resistant ones. Method: First, we analyzed the literature to define a subset of 15 agile practices potentially relevant to cryptographic software development. Then, we developed a questionnaire to assess the suitability of agile practices for obtaining crypto-agility. We performed a Web search of relevant documents about crypto-agility and quantum resistance and sent their authors the questionnaire. We also sent the questionnaire to cybersecurity officers of four Italian firms. We analyzed and discussed the responses to 32 valid questionnaires. Results: The respondents’ affiliations are evenly distributed between researchers and developers. Most of them are active, or somehow active, in quantum-resistant cryptography and use agile methods. Most of the agile practices are deemed to be quite useful, or very useful to get crypto-agility, the most effective being Continuous Integration and Coding Standards; the least appreciated is Self-organizing Team. Conclusion: According to researchers and developers working in the field, the safe transition of cryptographic algorithms to quantum-resistant ones can benefit from the adoption of many agile practices. Further software engineering research is needed to integrate agile practices in more formal cryptographic software development processes.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a systematic review of quantum computing approaches to healthcare-related computational problems, with an emphasis on quantum-theoretical foundations and algorithmic complexity. We adopt an optimized machine learning methodology—combining Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)—to analyze the literature and identify key research themes at the intersection of quantum computing and healthcare. A total of 63 peer-reviewed studies were analyzed, with 41 categorized under the first domain and 22 under the second. This approach revealed two primary research directions: (1) quantum computing for artificial intelligence in healthcare, and (2) quantum computing for healthcare data security. We highlight the theoretical advances underlying these domains, from novel quantum machine learning algorithms for biomedical data to quantum cryptographic protocols for securing medical information. A gradient boosting classifier further validates our taxonomy by reliably distinguishing between the two categories of research, demonstrating the robustness of the identified themes, with an accuracy of 84.2\%, a precision of 88.9\%, a recall of 84.2\%, an F1-score of 84.5\%, and an area under the curve of 0.875. Interpretability analysis using Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) exposes distinguishing features of each category (e.g., references to biomedical applications versus blockchain-based security frameworks), offering transparency into the literature-driven categorization, with the latter showing the most significant contributions to topic assignment (ranging from −0.133 to +0.128). Our findings underscore that quantum algorithms offer significant potential to enhance data security, optimize complex diagnostic computations, and provide computational speedups for health informatics. We also identify outstanding challenges—such as the need for scalable quantum algorithms and error-tolerant hardware integration—that must be addressed to translate these theoretical advancements into real-world clinical impact.

  abstract = {The widespread adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT) raises significant concerns regarding security and energy efficiency, particularly for low-resource devices. To address these IoT issues, we propose a cross-layer IoT architecture employing machine learning (ML) models and lightweight cryptography. Our proposed solution is based on role-based access control (RBAC), ensuring secure authentication in large-scale IoT deployments while preventing unauthorized access attempts. We integrate layer-specific ML models, such as long short-term memory networks for temporal anomaly detection and decision trees for application-layer validation, along with adaptive speck encryption for the dynamic adjustment of cryptographic overheads. We then introduce a granular RBAC system that incorporates energy-aware policies. The novelty of this work is the proposal of a cross-layer IoT architecture that harmonizes ML-driven security with energy-efficient operations. The performance of the proposed cross-layer system is evaluated by extensive simulations. The results obtained show that the proposed system can reduce false positives up to 32\% and enhance system security by preventing unauthorized access up to 95\%. We also achieve 30\% reduction in power consumption using the proposed lightweight Speck encryption method compared to the traditional advanced encryption standard (AES). By leveraging convolutional neural networks and ML, our approach significantly enhances IoT security and energy efficiency in practical scenarios such as smart cities, homes, and schools.},

  abstract = {Large-scale events, such as festivals and public gatherings, pose serious problems in terms of traffic congestion, slow transaction processing, and security risks to transportation planning. This study proposes a blockchain-based solution for enhancing the efficiency and security of intelligent transport systems (ITS) by utilizing state channels and rollups. Throughput is optimized, enabling transaction speeds of 800 to 3500 transactions per second (TPS) and delays of 5 to 1.5 s. Prevent data tampering, strengthen security, and enhance data integrity from 89\% to 99.999\%, as well as encryption efficacy from 90\% to 98\%. Furthermore, our system reduces congestion, optimizes vehicle movement, and shares real-time, secure data with stakeholders. Practical applications include fast and safe road toll payments, faster public transit ticketing, improved emergency response coordination, and enhanced urban mobility. The decentralized blockchain helps maintain trust among users, transportation authorities, and event organizers. Our approach extends beyond large-scale events and proposes a path toward ubiquitous, Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven decision-making in a broader urban transit network, informing future operations in dynamic traffic optimization. This study demonstrates the potential of blockchain to create more intelligent, more secure, and scalable transportation systems, which will help reduce urban mobility inefficiencies and contribute to the development of resilient smart cities.},

  abstract = {The use of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) systems for digital identity management is gaining traction and interest. Countries such as Bhutan have already implemented an SSI infrastructure to manage the identity of their citizens. The EU, thanks to the revised eIDAS regulation, is opening the door for SSI vendors to develop SSI systems for the planned EU digital identity wallet. These developments, which fall within the sovereign domain, raise questions about individual privacy. The design of SSI systems is complex, often characterized by a large number of components and architectural choices because the current SSI communities differ on how to create identifiers, how to build and present credentials, and even how to design a user wallet. SSI stacks developed by different organizations provide different privacy features for different privacy needs. This paper performs a systematic mapping and review of SSI components and technologies into a novel four-layer privacy framework to address the design complexity of SSI systems. Based on this review, we provide an accompanying Design Assistance Dashboard (DAD). The DAD shows the interdependencies between SSI components in different layers, and maps these components to different privacy requirements and considerations, even providing a simple privacy class for each component.},

  abstract = {Digital Twins (DT) virtually model cyber-physical objects via sensory inputs by simulating or monitoring their behavior. Therefore, DTs usually harbor vast quantities of Internet of Things (IoT) components (e.g., sensors) that gather, process, and offload sensitive information (e.g., healthcare) to the cloud. It is imperative to ensure the trustworthiness of such sensitive information with long-term and compromise-resilient security guarantees. Digital signatures provide scalable authentication and integrity with non-repudiation and are vital tools for DTs. Post-quantum cryptography (PQC) and forward-secure signatures are two fundamental tools to offer long-term security and breach resiliency. However, NIST-PQC signature standards are exorbitantly costly for embedded DT components and are infeasible when forward-security is also considered. Moreover, NIST-PQC signatures do not admit aggregation, which is a highly desirable feature to mitigate the heavy storage and transmission burden in DTs. Finally, NIST recommends hybrid PQ solutions to enable cryptographic agility and transitional security. Yet, there is a significant gap in the state of the art in the achievement of all these advanced features simultaneously. Therefore, there is a significant need for lightweight digital signatures that offer compromise resiliency and compactness while permitting transitional security into the PQ era for DTs.                            We create a series of highly lightweight digital signatures called Hardware-ASisted Efficient Signature (               HASES               ) that meets the above requirements. The core of               HASES               ~is a hardware-assisted cryptographic commitment construct oracle (               CCO               ) that permits verifiers to obtain expensive commitments without signer interaction. We created three               HASES               ~schemes:               PQ-HASES               ~is a forward-secure PQ signature,               LA-HASES               ~is an efficient aggregate Elliptic-Curve signature, and               HY-HASES               ~is a novel hybrid scheme that combines               PQ-HASES               ~and               LA-HASES               ~with novel strong nesting and sequential aggregation.               HASES               ~does not require a secure-hardware on the signer. We prove that               HASES               ~schemes are secure and implemented them on commodity hardware and and 8-bit AVR ATmega2560. Our experiments confirm that               PQ-HASES               ~and               LA-HASES               ~are two magnitudes of times more signer efficient than their PQ and conventional-secure counterparts, respectively.               HY-HASES               ~outperforms NIST PQC and conventional signature combinations, offering a standard-compliant transitional solution for emerging DTs. We open-source               HASES               ~schemes for public-testing and adaptation.},

DS is of importance in a discipline oriented to the creation of successful artifacts. Several researchers have pioneered DS research in IS, yet over the past 15 years, little DS research has been done within the discipline. The lack of a methodology to serve as a commonly accepted framework for DS research and of a template for its presentation may have contributed to its slow adoption. The design science research methodology (DSRM) presented here incorporates principles, practices, and procedures required to carry out such research and meets three objectives: it is consistent with prior literature, it provides a nominal process model for doing DS research, and it provides a mental model for presenting and evaluating DS research in IS. The DS process includes six steps: problem identification and motivation, definition of the objectives for a solution, design and development, demonstration, evaluation, and communication. We demonstrate and evaluate the methodology by presenting four case studies in terms of the DSRM, including cases that present the design of a database to support health assessment methods, a software reuse measure, an Internet video telephony application, and an IS planning method. The designed methodology effectively satisfies the three objectives and has the potential to help aid the acceptance of DS research in the IS discipline.},

  abstract = {Several revolutionary applications have been built on the distributed ledgers of blockchain (BC) technology. Besides cryptocurrencies, many other application fields can be found in smart systems exploiting smart contracts and Self Sovereign Identity (SSI) management. The Hyperledger Indy platform is a suitable open-source solution for realizing permissioned BC systems for SSI projects. SSI applications usually require short response times from the underlying BC network, which may vary highly depending on the application type, the used BC software, and the actual BC deployment parameters. To support the developers and users of SSI applications, we present a detailed latency analysis of a permissioned BC system built with Indy and Aries. To streamline our experiments, we developed a Python application using containerized Indy and Aries components from official Hyperledger repositories. We deployed our experimental application on multiple virtual machines in the public Google Cloud Platform and on our local, private cloud using a Docker platform with Kubernetes. We evaluated and compared their performance benchmarked by Read and Write latencies. We found that the local Indy ledger reads and writes 30–50\%, and 65–85\% faster than the Indy ledger running on the Google Cloud Platform, respectively.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Blockchain technology has revolutionized various industries by enabling decentralized, transparent, and tamper-resistant digital transactions. However, despite its benefits, blockchain-based applications are vulnerable to security threats such as smart contract exploits, 51\% attacks, Sybil attacks, and private key compromises, posing significant risks to their integrity and reliability. Traditional security frameworks lack a comprehensive approach to systematically assess and mitigate these risks across different blockchain layers. To address this challenge, this paper proposes the blockchain cybersecurity risk assessment model (BCRAM), a structured framework designed to identify, analyze, evaluate, and mitigate security risks in blockchain systems. The methodology involves categorizing threats, assessing risks using quantitative and qualitative techniques, and validating the model through a case study on Ethereum. Results demonstrate that implementing BCRAM led to a 65\% reduction in smart contract exploits, a 70\% decrease in phishing incidents, and an 85\% improvement in distributed denial of service (DDoS) resilience, proving its effectiveness. This research offers a standardized risk assessment approach, providing valuable insights for developers, security analysts to enhance blockchain security.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {The first cryptocurrency was invented in 2008/09, but the Blockchain-Web3 concept is still in its infancy, and the cyber risk is constantly changing. Cybersecurity should also be adapting to these changes to ensure security of personal data and continuation of operations. This article starts with a comparison of existing cybersecurity standards and regulations from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO)—ISO27001, followed by a discussion on more specific and recent standards and regulations, such as the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures and the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (CPMI-IOSCO), and more general cryptography (and post-quantum cryptography), in the context of cybersecurity. These topics are followed up by a review of recent technical reports on cyber risk/security and a discussion on cloud security questions. Comparison of Blockchain cyber risk is also performed on the recent EU standards on cyber security, including European Cybersecurity Certification Scheme (EUCS)—cloud, and US standards—The National Vulnerability Database (NVD) Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The study includes a review of Blockchain endpoint security, and new technologies e.g., IoT. The research methodology applied is a review and case study analysing secondary data on cybersecurity. The research significance is the integration of knowledge from the United States (US), the European Union (EU), the United Kingdom (UK), and international standards and frameworks on cybersecurity that can be alighted to new Blockchain projects. The results show that cybersecurity standards are not designed in close cooperation between the two major western blocks: US and EU. In addition, while the US is still leading in this area, the security standards for cryptocurrencies, internet-of-things, and blockchain technologies have not evolved as fast as the technologies have. The key finding from this study is that although the crypto-market has grown into a multi-trillion industry, the crypto-market has also lost over 70\% since its peak, causing significant financial loss for individuals and cooperation’s. Despite this significant impact to individuals and society, cybersecurity standards and financial governance regulations are still in their infancy, specifically in the UK.},

  abstract = {Software containerization, for which Docker is the reference tool, is widely adopted in modern software engineering. The performance of the Docker build process in terms of image size and build time is crucial to developers. While previous work and Docker itself provide best practices to keep the images small and fast to build, we conjecture that developers might adopt undocumented practices. In this paper, we present an empirical study in which we aim (i) to mine the practices adopted by developers for improving the image size and build time, and (ii) to measure the impact of such practices. As for the mining study, we manually analyzed a total of 1,026 commits from open-source projects in which developers declared they wanted to improve the image size or build time. We categorize such changes and define a taxonomy of 46 optimization strategies, including practices such as removing temporary files (e.g., package manager cache) or improving the structure of the Dockerfile (e.g., using multi-stage build). Such a taxonomy reveals some previously undocumented techniques, providing valuable insights for developers. As for the measurement study, we empirically assess the actual improvement in image size and build time (over 20 builds) of the most frequent change patterns observed in the mining study. Our results show that changing the base image has the best results in terms of image size, but it negatively affects the build time. On the other hand, we observed no change pattern that significantly reduces the build time. Our study provides interesting insights for both tool makers who want to support practitioners in improving Dockerfile build performance and practitioners themselves, who can better decide how to optimize their Dockerfiles.},

  abstract = {As the world is gradually moving towards digitization, forgery of vital digital documents has become relatively easy. Therefore, the need for efficient and secure verification and authentication practices of digital documents is also increasing. Self-sovereign identity (SSI) is a set of technologies that build on core concepts in identity management, blockchain technology, and cryptography. SSI enables entities to create fraud-proof verifiable credentials and instantly verify the authenticity of a digital credential. The online document verification solutions must deal with a myriad of issues in regard to privacy and security. Moreover, various challenging and tedious processes have made document verification overly complex and time-consuming which motivated us to conduct this research. This work presents a novel framework for online document verification based on SSI technology. The solution address the complexity and interoperability issues that are present in the current digital document verification systems. We look at a particular use case, i.e., document verification in online loan processing and evaluate how this proposed approach can make an impact on the existing system. Our solution based on SSI standards replaces the intermediary and enables trust between players in the ecosystem. The technology also holds the potential to make the system more efficient, interoperable, and privacy-preserving.},

  abstract = {Creating and utilizing digital identities are fundamental steps towards accessing online services. In order to facilitate the management of user identities, the concept of identity management has been introduced. Various systems and protocols have been developed to manage online identities. However, these systems are provider-centric, focusing on aiding providers in managing their user bases. As a result, users often have limited control over their identity data and remain unaware of how centralized identity providers use or potentially misuse their data. Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) has emerged as a new paradigm in the digital identity management landscape, aiming to empower users by allowing them greater control over their identity data. Although SSI is a relatively new domain, there have been numerous efforts, primarily from the industry, to introduce SSI standards, protocols, and systems, with multiple options in each category. Researchers eager to contribute to the SSI domain might find it challenging to understand the interconnections among these components. Notably, the SSI domain faces several challenges, as highlighted in various research works. These challenges must be addressed before SSI can achieve widespread adoption. This article presents a comprehensive systematic literature review of SSI, offers a detailed taxonomy, and identifies and analyzes the open challenges in SSI.},

When a service provider requests data from the user, the user sends it directly to the service provider, bypassing third-party intermediaries. Thus, SSI reduces identity providers’ involvement in the identification, authentication, and authorization, thereby increasing user privacy. Additionally, users can share portions of their personal information with service providers, significantly improving user privacy. This identity model has drawn the attention of researchers and organizations worldwide, resulting in an increase in both scientific and non-scientific literature on the subject. This study conducts a comprehensive and rigorous systematic review of the literature and a systematic mapping of theoretical and practical advances in SSI. We identified and analyzed evidence from reviewed materials to address four research questions, resulting in a novel SSI taxonomy used to categorize and review publications.

  abstract = {Abstract             The exponential growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) has driven considerable advancements in many domains, such as healthcare, smart cities, and industrial automation. However, this connectivity introduces a broad attack surface, making IoT ecosystems vulnerable to sophisticated cyberattacks, including Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attacks, and data breaches, which may severely degrade the Quality of Service (QoS) metrics, that may include latency, throughput, and packet loss. This paper provides a detailed survey of contemporary attack detection techniques, such as signature-based, anomaly-based and hybrid methods, focusing on their efficiency in securing IoT systems without undermining QoS. The impact of these methods on critical QoS parameters is analyzed in resource-constrained IoT environments, where computational and memory limitations deter the implementation of traditional security measures. Additionally, emerging approaches such as artificial intelligence (AI)-driven anomaly detection, federated learning, and blockchain are examined for their potential to balance robust security with optimal performance. The analysis reveals the trade-offs between detection accuracy, resource consumption, and QoS maintenance, identifying research gaps related to post-attack recovery mechanisms and real-time adaptive security models. A cross-domain comparison of attack detection techniques reveals how different IoT applications, from smart healthcare to industrial IoT, impact the performance of these solutions. The results provide direction for future research on developing scalable, resource-efficient security models that can maintain high QoS levels in complex IoT ecosystems.},

While a number of high-level requirements (e.g., related to privacy and security) are established to make interoperability among Member States possible, the eIDAS regulation does not explicitly specify the technologies that can be adopted during the development phase to meet the requirements as mentioned earlier. To the best of our knowledge, there is no work available in the literature investigating the technological trends within the notified eIDAS electronic identity schemes used by Member States. To fill this gap, this paper analyzes how the different technological trends of notified schemes satisfy the requirements of the eIDAS regulation. To do this, we define a set of research questions that allow us to investigate the correlations between different design dimensions such as security, privacy, and usability. Based on these findings, we provide a set of lessons learned that would be valuable to the security community, as they can provide useful insights on how to more efficiently protect interoperable national digital identities. Furthermore, we provide a brief overview regarding the new eIDAS regulation (eIDAS 2.0) that aims to provide a more privacy-preserving electronic identity solution by moving from a centralized approach to a decentralized one.},

A natural choice for a VDR is a distributed ledger or blockchain. Among the most stable and popular frameworks for SSI is Hyperledger Indy. Indy includes a custom implementation of a public permissioned ledger as a VDR. The Indy community has been developing a new experimental approach for a VDR in Indy: a permissioned ledger based on Hyperledger Besu.

The model serves a number of pedagogical purposes: to integrate the various course components, to provide a formal foundation for the course content, to foster practical analytical skills, and to provide a framework for case discussions and student projects. Moreover, the model is intended to acquaint students with the dynamics of information systems in organizations and to help them recognize the benefits, dangers, and limitations of these systems.

Although existing QCs need to accommodate more qubits to break cryptographic algorithms, the concern of ''Store-Now-Decrypt-Later'' (i.e., adversaries store encrypted data today and decrypt them once powerful QCs become available) highlights the necessity to adopt quantum-safe approaches as soon as possible. In this work, we investigate the performance impact of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) on TLS 1.3. Different signature algorithms and key agreements (as proposed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)) are examined through black- and white-box measurements to get precise handshake latencies and computational costs per participating library. We emulated loss, bandwidth, and delay to analyze constrained environments. Our results reveal that HQC and Kyber are on par with our current state-of-the-art, while Dilithium and Falcon are even faster. We observed no performance drawback from using hybrid algorithms; moreover, on higher NIST security levels, PQC outperformed any algorithm in use today. Hence, we conclude that post-quantum TLS is suitable for adoption in today's systems.},

  abstract = {Data stored in the cloud is particularly vulnerable to attacks, especially when at rest or in transit. This makes the security of data in the cloud in terms of its integrity, confidentiality and availability a major security concern. While existing studies on cloud data security have garnered attention from cybersecurity researchers, there has been limited focus on developing a comprehensive data security framework that integrates both technical and social measures. The general objective of the study was to develop a data security framework for protecting data at rest and data in transit in the cloud. The qualitative research approach was chosen using interviews, archival records and physical artefacts as the source of data for the study. Using the purposive sampling technique, ten cyber security experts within the banking sector with not less than five years of practice were selected. Thematic analysis was used in analysing the collected data which led to the identification of the factors for the development of the framework. The study developed the framework for protecting data at rest and data in motion in the cloud based on the encryption technologies, installation of firewalls and antivirus as well as access control techniques. First Homomorphic encryption technologies were implemented in the framework to secure both storage devices and web connections. Other security factors were installation of firewall and antivirus. The findings revealed that access and usage control strategies integrate user identification and authentication. Additionally, these strategies incorporate safeguards for confidentiality, data integrity, and non-repudiation, securing both data-at-rest and data-in-motion. The findings also indicated that audit trails provide electronic records that offer security support documentation and history that is used to authenticate operational actions and mitigate challenges with non-compliance. Additionally, the findings emphasized the importance of social strategies such as staff training and industry collaboration in enhancing data security. These strategies aim to raise awareness of security threats and inform best practices for securing organizational data. The study recommends that banks consider both technical and social aspects when implementing data protection security measures especially implementing homomorphic encryption to secure data and implement Cyber Security training policies.},

The substation that was the location of the study was the 150/20 KV Kentungan Substation, Sleman, Yogyakarta Special Region. Power transformers are the most important electrical equipment in a substation. The power transformer functions as a provider of electrical energy that has been transmitted from the power plant to then be channeled to electricity loads. In its operational it is very important to know the capacity and capacity of power transformers in serving electric loads for decades to come, with the aim that the electric power service can take place well. Therefore, the forecasting of the power transformer is important to know in the framework of the operational planning of a good substation. The results of the study indicate that the peak load of power transformers in the period 2014 to 2016 is still in a safe level, where the maximum peak load is 93\% of the total capacity of the transformer. However, it is recommended that the power transformer capacity be planned to begin to anticipate the growth of loads in the coming years.},

This paper explores hardware-enforced cyber-security for critical infrastructures. It examines a quantum-safe “Software-Defined-Deterministic IIoT” (SDD-IIoT), with a new forwarding-plane (sub-layer-3a) for deterministic M2M traffic flows. A “Software-Defined Networking” (SDN) control plane controls many “Software-Defined-Deterministic Wide-Area Networks” (SDD-WANs), realized with FPGAs. The SDN control plane provides an “Admission-Control/Access-Control” system for network-bandwidth, using collaborating Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based “Zero Trust Architectures” (ZTAs). Hardware-enforced access-control eliminates all congestion, BufferBloat, and DoS/DDoS attacks, significantly reduces buffer-sizes, and supports ultra-reliable-low-latency communications in the forwarding-plane. The forwarding-plane can: (i) Encrypt/Authenticate M2M flows using quantum-safe ciphers, to withstand attacks by Quantum Computers; (ii) Implement “guaranteed intrusion detection systems” in FPGAs, to detect cyber-attacks embedded within billions of IIoT packets; (iii) Provide guaranteed immunity to external cyber-attacks, and exceptionally strong immunity to internal cyber-attacks; (iv) Save USD 100s of billions annually by exploiting FPGAs; and (v) Enable hybrid Classical-Quantum networks, by integrating a “quantum key distribution” (QKD) network with a classical forwarding plane with exceptionally strong cyber-security, determined by the computational hardness of cracking Symmetric Key Cryptography. Extensive experimental results for an SDD-WAN over the European Union are reported.},

  abstract = {Abstract             In recent years, blockchain technology has emerged as a promising solution for securing electronic health records (EHRs) while preserving patient privacy. Traditional e-health systems facilitate EHR sharing among healthcare providers but also introduce significant privacy risks, such as unauthorized access and data breaches. Blockchain, when integrated with privacy-preserving techniques, enhances transparency, integrity, and availability in EHR management. Smart contracts further strengthen security by enabling automated authentication and access control. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of blockchain-based access control frameworks in healthcare, categorizing them into permissioned and permissionless approaches. It also explores cryptographic privacy-preserving techniques designed to mitigate privacy risks. Additionally, blockchain platforms and consensus protocols commonly used in these frameworks are analyzed. The methodology follows a structured paper selection process, leading to the final inclusion of 45 research papers focusing on blockchain-based privacy preservation and access control in healthcare. Furthermore, it presents real-world case studies that illustrate the practical implementation of blockchain-based access control in healthcare settings, highlighting their strengths and challenges. Finally, it identifies privacy-related challenges, open research issues, and future directions to guide further research in this evolving domain.},

Cyber threat intelligence (CTI) is critical for detecting and mitigating such threats, yet traditional centralized CTI approaches face limitations in latency, scalability, and data privacy. Federated learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving alternative by enabling decentralized model training without sharing raw data. This survey explores how FL can enhance CTI in IIoT environments. It reviews FL architectures, orchestration strategies, and aggregation methods, and maps their applications to domains such as intrusion detection, malware analysis, botnet mitigation, anomaly detection, and trust management. Among its contributions is an empirical synthesis comparing FL aggregation strategies—including FedAvg, FedProx, Krum, ClippedAvg, and Multi-Krum—across accuracy, robustness, and efficiency under IIoT constraints. The paper also presents a taxonomy of FL-based CTI approaches and outlines future research directions to support the development of secure, scalable, and decentralized threat intelligence systems for industrial ecosystems.},

  abstract = {With the rapid proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and mobile applications and the growing demand for low-latency services, edge computing has emerged as a transformative paradigm that brings computation and storage closer to end users. However, the dynamic nature and limited resources of edge networks bring challenges such as load imbalance and high latency while satisfying user requests. Service migration, the dynamic redeployment of service instances across distributed edge nodes, has become a key enabler for solving these challenges and optimizing edge network characteristics. Moreover, the low-latency nature of edge computing requires that service migration strategies must be in real time in order to ensure latency requirements. Thus, this paper presents a systematic survey of real-time service migration in edge networks. Specifically, we first introduce four network architectures and four basic models for real-time service migration. We then summarize four research motivations for real-time service migration and the real-time guarantee introduced during the implementation of migration strategies. To support these motivations, we present key techniques for solving the task of real-time service migration and how these algorithms and models facilitate the real-time performance of migration. We also explore latency-sensitive application scenarios, such as smart cities, smart homes, and smart manufacturing, where real-time service migration plays a critical role in sustaining performance and adaptability under dynamic conditions. Finally, we summarize the key challenges and outline promising future research directions for real-time service migration. This survey aims to provide a structured and in-depth theoretical foundation to guide future research on real-time service migration in edge networks.},

As a result of their limited processing power efficiency, memory, and battery life, traditional cryptographic algorithms like elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), Rivest–Shamir–Adleman (RSA), and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) are sometimes too resource‐intensive for these devices. Lightweight cryptography has become a crucial field as a remedy, created especially to maintain security while maximizing energy efficiency and reducing resource usage. With an emphasis on contrasting well‐known lightweight block ciphers and pointing out areas for future research, this paper examines the most recent developments in lightweight cryptographic methods. In order to synthesize insights into present issues and future goals, it explores cutting‐edge methods that improve performance, security, and energy efficiency. Among the main trends that were covered were the trade‐offs between resource limitations and security strength, hardware–software co‐optimization, block and stream cipher optimization, and hybrid encryption techniques. The study’s conclusion emphasizes how urgently more research is needed to create cryptographic solutions that can sufficiently safeguard IoT devices.},
