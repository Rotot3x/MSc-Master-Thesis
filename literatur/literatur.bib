  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               The rapid expansion of Internet of Things applications in healthcare has created new opportunities for improving patient care through real-time monitoring and data sharing. However, this growth also introduces significant challenges related to data security, privacy, and system efficiency, especially for devices with limited processing power and energy resources. To address these issues, this study introduces a blockchain-based lightweight hashing system specifically designed for healthcare environments with resource-constrained devices. The goal is to ensure secure, efficient, and scalable handling of sensitive medical data without overwhelming the capabilities of connected devices.                                         Results               The proposed system combines a collision-resistant, lightweight hash function with blockchain technology to enhance data integrity, authentication, and privacy. The hash function minimizes computational demands, making it ideal for wearable and embedded healthcare devices. Blockchain integration enables decentralized data management, preventing unauthorized access and tampering. The system generates unique, immutable patient identifiers and protects electronic health information from common security threats, including collision attacks, Sybil attacks, and cryptographic analysis. Simulation results show improved computational efficiency, lower latency, and effective handling of high transaction volumes with minimal resource usage.                                         Conclusions               This research presents a secure and efficient framework for managing medical data in healthcare Internet of Things applications. By leveraging lightweight cryptographic techniques and decentralized data structures, the system addresses key limitations in current solutions while supporting scalability and real-world deployment. Potential applications include secure patient monitoring, real-time sharing of health data, and decentralized management of medical records. The proposed approach provides a foundation for future advancements in digital healthcare systems, particularly in remote care, emergency response, and wearable health technologies.},

  abstract = {The introduction of mobile banking is essential in today’s financial sector, where technological innovation plays a critical role. To remain competitive in the current market, businesses must analyze client attitudes and perspectives, as these influence long-term demand and overall profitability. While previous studies have explored general adoption behaviors, limited research has examined how individual factors such as social influence, lifestyle compatibility, financial technology self-efficacy, and perceived usage cost affect mobile banking adoption among specific generational cohorts. This study addresses that gap by offering insights into these variables, contributing to the growing literature on mobile banking adoption, and presenting actionable recommendations for financial institutions targeting younger market segments. Using a structured questionnaire survey, data were collected from both users and non-users of mobile banking among the Gen Z population in the United States. The regression model significantly predicts mobile banking adoption, with an intercept of −0.548 (p~{$<~$}0.001). Among the independent variables, perceived cost of usage has the strongest positive effect on adoption (B=0.857, β=0.722, p~{$<~$}0.001), suggesting that adoption increases when mobile banking is perceived as more affordable. Social influence also has a significant positive impact (B=0.642, β=0.643, p~{$<~$}0.001), indicating that peer influence is a central driver of adoption decisions. However, self-efficacy shows a significant negative relationship (B=−0.343, β=−0.339, p~{$<~$}0.001), and lifestyle compatibility was found to be statistically insignificant (p=0.615). These findings suggest that reducing perceived costs, through lower fees, data bundling, or clearer communication about affordability, can directly enhance adoption among Gen Z consumers. Furthermore, leveraging peer influence via referral rewards, Partnerships with influencers, and in-app social features can increase user adoption. Since digital self-efficacy presents a barrier for some, banks should prioritize simplifying user interfaces and offering guided assistance, such as tutorials or chat-based support. Future research may employ longitudinal designs or analyze real-life transaction data for a more objective understanding of behavior. Additional variables like trust, perceived risk, and regulatory policies, not included in this study, should be integrated into future models to offer a more comprehensive analysis.},

The protocol introduces challenge–response–pair mechanisms enabling the generation, distribution, and verification of cryptographic public–private key pairs in a distributed network with multi-factor authentication, tokens, and template-less biometry. While protocols using generic digital signature algorithms are proposed, the focus of the experimental work was to implement a solution based on Crystals-Dilithium, a post-quantum cryptographic algorithm under standardization. Crystals-Dilithium generates public keys consisting of two interrelated parts, a matrix generating seed, and a vector computed from the matrix and two randomly picked vectors forming the secret key. We show how such a split of the public keys lends itself to a two-way authentication of both the trusted entity and the users.},

  abstract = {The convergence of decentralized artificial intelligence (DAI), blockchain technology, and smart contracts is reshaping the design and governance of intelligent systems. As these technologies rapidly evolve, addressing privacy within their architecture, usage models, and associated risks has become increasingly critical. This systematic literature review examines architectural patterns, governance frameworks, real-world applications, and persistent challenges in DAI systems. It identifies prevailing designs such as federated learning integrated with consensus protocols, smart contract-based incentive mechanisms, and decentralized verification methods. Drawing from a diverse body of recent literature, the review highlights implementations across sectors, including healthcare, finance, IoT, autonomous systems, and intelligent infrastructure, each demonstrating significant contributions to privacy, security, and collaborative innovation. Despite these advancements, DAI systems face ongoing obstacles such as scalability limitations, privacy trade-offs, and difficulties with regulatory compliance. The review emphasizes the need for integrative governance approaches that balance transparency, accountability, incentive alignment, and ethical oversight. These elements are proposed as co-evolving pillars essential to establishing trustworthiness in decentralized AI ecosystems. This work offers a comprehensive review for understanding the current landscape and guiding the development of responsible and effective DAI systems in the Web3 era.},

  abstract = {The increasing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI)‐driven unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in military, commercial, and surveillance operations has introduced significant security challenges, including cyber threats, adversarial AI attacks, and communication vulnerabilities. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the key security threats and challenges faced by AI‐powered UAVs, such as unauthorized access, GPS spoofing, adversarial manipulations, and UAV hijacking. We analyze advanced solutions including blockchain‐secured UAV networks, post‐quantum cryptography (PQC), adversarial AI training, self‐healing AI models, and multi‐factor authentication (MFA), which collectively strengthen UAV cybersecurity defenses. Our findings highlight the critical role of emerging technologies, including self‐adaptive AI‐driven UAVs capable of detecting and learning from novel cyber threats autonomously. We also discuss the integration of 6\,G‐powered communication networks for secure and ultra‐fast encrypted transmissions, as well as Edge AI computing that enables real‐time, onboard threat detection without cloud dependency. Furthermore, decentralized intelligence models and blockchain‐based authentication are shown to enhance security in UAV swarms by preventing unauthorized infiltration. Overall, this review emphasizes the necessity of multilayered security frameworks that combine AI techniques, cryptographic measures, and decentralized swarm protection to ensure resilient, autonomous, and secure UAV operations in complex and high‐risk environments.},

  abstract = {The concept of Self-Sovereign Identity insert ignore into journalissuearticles values(SSI);, where we can store our personal information and documents securely, as proven by the relevant authorities, and share them with the people we want, has become widespread as the personal secure data storage method that we need most in recent years. We have to physically carry our evidence-based identities obtained from events or institutions. Keeping our identity, age, health status, educational status, and many other personal data inaccessible to others and without questioning the accuracy when we share them also restricts their use in different areas. Sharing the data depending on the consent of the people and presenting the data accurately and reliably has become one of our most important needs today. With the concept of SSI, it has become possible for us to save our data as distributed, inaccessible, unalterable, and incorruptible. In addition, with the possibility of public access to the information with the consent of the people, it is possible to instantly share the information with the people/institutions we want. This study will explain mobile application processes created on SSI infrastructure. It will be possible to add different institutions to the developed system and to identify the added institutions to the users. The identities given by the institutions will be able to be proven by different institutions. Thus, the operating structure of this system will be transferred with a verifiable and reliable infrastructure. This study, it is aimed to contribute to the general operating processes of those who will develop the SSI infrastructure. To develop such a system, it has been determined that ACA-Py is the most suitable infrastructure framework. After comparing the efficacy of Askar and Indy for the selection of the wallet to be used, it was determined that the Askar wallet would be used in the system.},

  abstract = {Creating search strategies for systematic reviews, finding the best balance between sensitivity and specificity, and translating search strategies between databases is challenging. Several methods describe standards for systematic search strategies, but a consistent approach for creating an exhaustive search strategy has not yet been fully described in enough detail to be fully replicable. The authors have established a method that describes step by step the process of developing a systematic search strategy as needed in the systematic review. This method describes how single-line search strategies can be prepared in a text document by typing search syntax (such as field codes, parentheses, and Boolean operators) before copying and pasting search terms (keywords and free-text synonyms) that are found in the thesaurus. To help ensure term completeness, we developed a novel optimization technique that is mainly based on comparing the results retrieved by thesaurus terms with those retrieved by the free-text search words to identify potentially relevant candidate search terms. Macros in Microsoft Word have been developed to convert syntaxes between databases and interfaces almost automatically. This method helps information specialists in developing librarian-mediated searches for systematic reviews as well as medical and health care practitioners who are searching for evidence to answer clinical questions. The described method can be used to create complex and comprehensive search strategies for different databases and interfaces, such as those that are needed when searching for relevant references for systematic reviews, and will assist both information specialists and practitioners when they are searching the biomedical literature.},

Though the significance of literature reviews has never been in doubt, researchers, especially novice researchers, still struggle with developing effective strategies for reviewing literature. An important reason for this difficulty is the rapidly increasing number of potentially relevant publications—not all of which necessarily add value to a literature review. As such, avoiding standing on the shoulders of dwarfs literature search emerges as a major issue in crafting an effective literature review. In this paper, we discuss challenges of literature searches in the increasingly dynamic context of information systems (IS) research and make recommendations for how to deal with them. We present practical guidelines and a checklist to help researchers with planning and organizing their literature searches. Download: http://aisel.aisnet.org/cais/vol37/iss1/9/},

  abstract = {The integration of electric vehicles (EVs) into smart grids (SGs) is reshaping both energy systems and mobility infrastructures. This review presents a comprehensive and cross-disciplinary synthesis of current technologies, methodologies, and challenges associated with EV–SG interaction. Unlike prior reviews that address these aspects in isolation, this work uniquely connects three critical pillars: (i) the evolution of energy storage technologies, including lithium-ion, second-life, and hybrid systems; (ii) optimisation and predictive control techniques using artificial intelligence (AI) for real-time energy management and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) coordination; and (iii) cybersecurity risks and post-quantum solutions required to safeguard increasingly decentralised and data-intensive grid environments. The novelty of this review lies in its integrated perspective, highlighting how emerging innovations, such as federated AI models, blockchain-secured V2G transactions, digital twin simulations, and quantum-safe cryptography, are converging to overcome existing limitations in scalability, resilience, and interoperability. Furthermore, we identify underexplored research gaps, such as standardisation of bidirectional communication protocols, regulatory inertia in V2G market participation, and the lack of unified privacy-preserving data architectures. By mapping current advancements and outlining a strategic research roadmap, this article provides a forward-looking foundation for the development of secure, flexible, and grid-responsive EV ecosystems. The findings support policymakers, engineers, and researchers in advancing the technical and regulatory landscape necessary to scale EV–SG integration within sustainable smart cities.},

  abstract = {The growing deployment of the Internet of Things (IoT) across various sectors introduces significant security and privacy challenges. Although numerous individual solutions exist, comprehensive frameworks that effectively combine advanced technologies to address evolving threats are lacking. This paper presents the Integrated Adaptive Security Framework for IoT (IASF-IoT), which integrates artificial intelligence, blockchain technology, and quantum-resistant cryptography into a unified solution tailored for IoT environments. Central to the framework is an adaptive AI-driven security orchestration mechanism, complemented by blockchain-based identity management, lightweight quantum-resistant protocols, and Digital Twins to predict and proactively mitigate threats. A theoretical performance model and large-scale simulation involving 1000 heterogeneous IoT devices were used to evaluate the framework. Results showed that IASF-IoT achieved detection accuracy between 85\% and 99\%, with simulated energy consumption remaining below 1.5 mAh per day and response times averaging around 2 s. These findings suggest that the framework offers strong potential for scalable, low-overhead security in resource-constrained IoT environments.},

  abstract = {In this work, we present a set of comprehensive experimental studies on Hyperledger Besu in private blockchain. We aim to exhibit its performance characteristics in terms of transaction throughput, latency, resource utilization, and scalability, from the application perspective by adding a load balancer middleware. We have carefully designed a set of comparative experiments and judiciously selected typical parameters, including transaction send rate, network size, node flavor, load balancing, consensus, and block time. In particular, three proof of authority consensus algorithms, Clique, IBFT 2.0, and QBFT, are investigated. Through extensive experimental evaluations using the Hyperledger Caliper benchmark tool, we analyze how these parameters impact the performance of a private Besu blockchain. Our studies reveal several interesting findings: 1) Blockchain parameters, e.g., block time and block size, are the most significant factors in determining Besu performance; 2) The performance of Besu is bottlenecked by transaction execution and blockchain state updates, which are determined by parameters such as node computation power, transaction complexity, and load balancing; 3) A Besu network with QBFT consensus can scale up to 14 validators without noticeable performance loss. Our findings shed some light on further performance improvement of Hyperledger Besu. The identified bottlenecks and root cause analysis provide insightful suggestions for blockchain practitioners to build performant enterprise applications.},

  abstract = {Blockchain technology has introduced new paradigms for identity management systems (IDMSs), enabling users to regain control over their identity data and reduce reliance on centralized authorities. In recent years, numerous blockchain-based IDMS solutions have emerged across both practical application domains and academic research. However, prior reviews often focus on single application areas, provide limited cross-domain comparison, and insufficiently address security challenges such as interoperability, revocation, and quantum resilience. This paper bridges these gaps by presenting the first comprehensive survey that examines IDMSs from three complementary perspectives: (i) historical evolution from centralized and federated models to blockchain-based decentralized architectures; (ii) a cross-domain taxonomy of blockchain-based IDMSs, encompassing both general-purpose designs and domain-specific implementations; and (iii) a security analysis of threats across the full identity lifecycle. Drawing on a systematic review of 47 studies published between 2019 and 2025 and conducted in accordance with the PRISMA methodology, the paper synthesizes academic research and real-world deployments to identify unresolved technical, economic, and social challenges, and to outline directions for future research. The findings aim to serve as a timely reference for both researchers and practitioners working toward secure, interoperable, and sustainable blockchain-based IDMSs.},

However, the rapid advancement of AI technologies brings significant security and privacy challenges. Recent incidents highlight vulnerabilities in AI systems, such as data leakage and malicious code injection, leading to severe financial losses and privacy breaches. Although existing studies have discussed specific security threats, they often lack detailed granularity and cover a limited scope. In this survey, we fill this gap by systematically categorizing and analyzing the threats and countermeasures in AI systems, which span both the training and inference stages, encompass centralized and distributed settings, and address both conventional and foundation AI models. By reviewing existing literature, we aim to provide AI researchers and practitioners with a thorough understanding of system vulnerabilities and current countermeasures. We hope to inspire further research into robust solutions, ultimately contributing to the development of resilient AI technologies.},

Blockchain-based smart contracts offer reliability, transparency, and efficiency in healthcare services, making them a focal point of many studies. However, challenges such as scalability, regulatory compliance, and interoperability continue to limit their widespread adoption. This study conducts a comprehensive literature review to assess blockchain-driven health data management, focusing on the classification of blockchain-based smart contracts in health policy and the health protocols and standards applicable to blockchain-based smart contracts. This review includes 80 core studies published between 2019 and 2025, identified through searches in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science using the PRISMA method. Risk of bias and methodological quality were assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute tool. The findings highlight the potential of blockchain-enabled smart contracts in health policy management, emphasizing their advantages, limitations, and implementation challenges. Additionally, the research underscores their transformative impact on digital health policies in ensuring data integrity, enhancing patient autonomy, and fostering a more resilient healthcare ecosystem.

The model treats the significant aspects of situational awareness, active defense, risk management, and recovery from incidents and is measured using globally standardized maturity models like ISO/IEC 15504, NIST CSF, and COBIT. The contributions include multidimensional measurements of resilience, a scored scale of capability (0–5), and domain-based classification enabling organizations to assess and enhance their cybersecurity situation in a formalized manner. The framework’s applicability is illustrated in three exploratory settings of power grids, healthcare systems, and airports, each constituting various levels of maturity in resilience.

  abstract = {This paper presents a systematic review of quantum computing approaches to healthcare-related computational problems, with an emphasis on quantum-theoretical foundations and algorithmic complexity. We adopt an optimized machine learning methodology—combining Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)—to analyze the literature and identify key research themes at the intersection of quantum computing and healthcare. A total of 63 peer-reviewed studies were analyzed, with 41 categorized under the first domain and 22 under the second. This approach revealed two primary research directions: (1) quantum computing for artificial intelligence in healthcare, and (2) quantum computing for healthcare data security. We highlight the theoretical advances underlying these domains, from novel quantum machine learning algorithms for biomedical data to quantum cryptographic protocols for securing medical information. A gradient boosting classifier further validates our taxonomy by reliably distinguishing between the two categories of research, demonstrating the robustness of the identified themes, with an accuracy of 84.2\%, a precision of 88.9\%, a recall of 84.2\%, an F1-score of 84.5\%, and an area under the curve of 0.875. Interpretability analysis using Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) exposes distinguishing features of each category (e.g., references to biomedical applications versus blockchain-based security frameworks), offering transparency into the literature-driven categorization, with the latter showing the most significant contributions to topic assignment (ranging from −0.133 to +0.128). Our findings underscore that quantum algorithms offer significant potential to enhance data security, optimize complex diagnostic computations, and provide computational speedups for health informatics. We also identify outstanding challenges—such as the need for scalable quantum algorithms and error-tolerant hardware integration—that must be addressed to translate these theoretical advancements into real-world clinical impact. This study emphasizes the importance of hybrid quantum-classical models and cross-disciplinary research to bridge the gap between cutting-edge quantum computing theory and its practical applications in healthcare.},

  abstract = {The widespread adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT) raises significant concerns regarding security and energy efficiency, particularly for low-resource devices. To address these IoT issues, we propose a cross-layer IoT architecture employing machine learning (ML) models and lightweight cryptography. Our proposed solution is based on role-based access control (RBAC), ensuring secure authentication in large-scale IoT deployments while preventing unauthorized access attempts. We integrate layer-specific ML models, such as long short-term memory networks for temporal anomaly detection and decision trees for application-layer validation, along with adaptive speck encryption for the dynamic adjustment of cryptographic overheads. We then introduce a granular RBAC system that incorporates energy-aware policies. The novelty of this work is the proposal of a cross-layer IoT architecture that harmonizes ML-driven security with energy-efficient operations. The performance of the proposed cross-layer system is evaluated by extensive simulations. The results obtained show that the proposed system can reduce false positives up to 32\% and enhance system security by preventing unauthorized access up to 95\%. We also achieve 30\% reduction in power consumption using the proposed lightweight Speck encryption method compared to the traditional advanced encryption standard (AES). By leveraging convolutional neural networks and ML, our approach significantly enhances IoT security and energy efficiency in practical scenarios such as smart cities, homes, and schools.},

  abstract = {Large-scale events, such as festivals and public gatherings, pose serious problems in terms of traffic congestion, slow transaction processing, and security risks to transportation planning. This study proposes a blockchain-based solution for enhancing the efficiency and security of intelligent transport systems (ITS) by utilizing state channels and rollups. Throughput is optimized, enabling transaction speeds of 800 to 3500 transactions per second (TPS) and delays of 5 to 1.5 s. Prevent data tampering, strengthen security, and enhance data integrity from 89\% to 99.999\%, as well as encryption efficacy from 90\% to 98\%. Furthermore, our system reduces congestion, optimizes vehicle movement, and shares real-time, secure data with stakeholders. Practical applications include fast and safe road toll payments, faster public transit ticketing, improved emergency response coordination, and enhanced urban mobility. The decentralized blockchain helps maintain trust among users, transportation authorities, and event organizers. Our approach extends beyond large-scale events and proposes a path toward ubiquitous, Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven decision-making in a broader urban transit network, informing future operations in dynamic traffic optimization. This study demonstrates the potential of blockchain to create more intelligent, more secure, and scalable transportation systems, which will help reduce urban mobility inefficiencies and contribute to the development of resilient smart cities.},

  abstract = {The use of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) systems for digital identity management is gaining traction and interest. Countries such as Bhutan have already implemented an SSI infrastructure to manage the identity of their citizens. The EU, thanks to the revised eIDAS regulation, is opening the door for SSI vendors to develop SSI systems for the planned EU digital identity wallet. These developments, which fall within the sovereign domain, raise questions about individual privacy. The design of SSI systems is complex, often characterized by a large number of components and architectural choices because the current SSI communities differ on how to create identifiers, how to build and present credentials, and even how to design a user wallet. SSI stacks developed by different organizations provide different privacy features for different privacy needs. This paper performs a systematic mapping and review of SSI components and technologies into a novel four-layer privacy framework to address the design complexity of SSI systems. Based on this review, we provide an accompanying Design Assistance Dashboard (DAD). The DAD shows the interdependencies between SSI components in different layers, and maps these components to different privacy requirements and considerations, even providing a simple privacy class for each component.},

  abstract = {Digital Twins (DT) virtually model cyber-physical objects via sensory inputs by simulating or monitoring their behavior. Therefore, DTs usually harbor vast quantities of Internet of Things (IoT) components (e.g., sensors) that gather, process, and offload sensitive information (e.g., healthcare) to the cloud. It is imperative to ensure the trustworthiness of such sensitive information with long-term and compromise-resilient security guarantees. Digital signatures provide scalable authentication and integrity with non-repudiation and are vital tools for DTs. Post-quantum cryptography (PQC) and forward-secure signatures are two fundamental tools to offer long-term security and breach resiliency. However, NIST-PQC signature standards are exorbitantly costly for embedded DT components and are infeasible when forward-security is also considered. Moreover, NIST-PQC signatures do not admit aggregation, which is a highly desirable feature to mitigate the heavy storage and transmission burden in DTs. Finally, NIST recommends hybrid PQ solutions to enable cryptographic agility and transitional security. Yet, there is a significant gap in the state of the art in the achievement of all these advanced features simultaneously. Therefore, there is a significant need for lightweight digital signatures that offer compromise resiliency and compactness while permitting transitional security into the PQ era for DTs.                            We create a series of highly lightweight digital signatures called Hardware-ASisted Efficient Signature (               HASES               ) that meets the above requirements. The core of               HASES               ~is a hardware-assisted cryptographic commitment construct oracle (               CCO               ) that permits verifiers to obtain expensive commitments without signer interaction. We created three               HASES               ~schemes:               PQ-HASES               ~is a forward-secure PQ signature,               LA-HASES               ~is an efficient aggregate Elliptic-Curve signature, and               HY-HASES               ~is a novel hybrid scheme that combines               PQ-HASES               ~and               LA-HASES               ~with novel strong nesting and sequential aggregation.               HASES               ~does not require a secure-hardware on the signer. We prove that               HASES               ~schemes are secure and implemented them on commodity hardware and and 8-bit AVR ATmega2560. Our experiments confirm that               PQ-HASES               ~and               LA-HASES               ~are two magnitudes of times more signer efficient than their PQ and conventional-secure counterparts, respectively.               HY-HASES               ~outperforms NIST PQC and conventional signature combinations, offering a standard-compliant transitional solution for emerging DTs. We open-source               HASES               ~schemes for public-testing and adaptation.},

Besides cryptocurrencies, many other application fields can be found in smart systems exploiting smart contracts and Self Sovereign Identity (SSI) management. The Hyperledger Indy platform is a suitable open-source solution for realizing permissioned BC systems for SSI projects. SSI applications usually require short response times from the underlying BC network, which may vary highly depending on the application type, the used BC software, and the actual BC deployment parameters. To support the developers and users of SSI applications, we present a detailed latency analysis of a permissioned BC system built with Indy and Aries. To streamline our experiments, we developed a Python application using containerized Indy and Aries components from official Hyperledger repositories. We deployed our experimental application on multiple virtual machines in the public Google Cloud Platform and on our local, private cloud using a Docker platform with Kubernetes. We evaluated and compared their performance benchmarked by Read and Write latencies. We found that the local Indy ledger reads and writes 30–50\%, and 65–85\% faster than the Indy ledger running on the Google Cloud Platform, respectively.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Blockchain technology has revolutionized various industries by enabling decentralized, transparent, and tamper-resistant digital transactions. However, despite its benefits, blockchain-based applications are vulnerable to security threats such as smart contract exploits, 51\% attacks, Sybil attacks, and private key compromises, posing significant risks to their integrity and reliability. Traditional security frameworks lack a comprehensive approach to systematically assess and mitigate these risks across different blockchain layers. To address this challenge, this paper proposes the blockchain cybersecurity risk assessment model (BCRAM), a structured framework designed to identify, analyze, evaluate, and mitigate security risks in blockchain systems. The methodology involves categorizing threats, assessing risks using quantitative and qualitative techniques, and validating the model through a case study on Ethereum. Results demonstrate that implementing BCRAM led to a 65\% reduction in smart contract exploits, a 70\% decrease in phishing incidents, and an 85\% improvement in distributed denial of service (DDoS) resilience, proving its effectiveness. This research offers a standardized risk assessment approach, providing valuable insights for developers, security analysts to enhance blockchain security.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {The first cryptocurrency was invented in 2008/09, but the Blockchain-Web3 concept is still in its infancy, and the cyber risk is constantly changing. Cybersecurity should also be adapting to these changes to ensure security of personal data and continuation of operations. This article starts with a comparison of existing cybersecurity standards and regulations from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO)—ISO27001, followed by a discussion on more specific and recent standards and regulations, such as the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures and the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (CPMI-IOSCO), and more general cryptography (and post-quantum cryptography), in the context of cybersecurity. These topics are followed up by a review of recent technical reports on cyber risk/security and a discussion on cloud security questions. Comparison of Blockchain cyber risk is also performed on the recent EU standards on cyber security, including European Cybersecurity Certification Scheme (EUCS)—cloud, and US standards—The National Vulnerability Database (NVD) Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The study includes a review of Blockchain endpoint security, and new technologies e.g., IoT. The research methodology applied is a review and case study analysing secondary data on cybersecurity. The research significance is the integration of knowledge from the United States (US), the European Union (EU), the United Kingdom (UK), and international standards and frameworks on cybersecurity that can be alighted to new Blockchain projects. The results show that cybersecurity standards are not designed in close cooperation between the two major western blocks: US and EU. In addition, while the US is still leading in this area, the security standards for cryptocurrencies, internet-of-things, and blockchain technologies have not evolved as fast as the technologies have. The key finding from this study is that although the crypto-market has grown into a multi-trillion industry, the crypto-market has also lost over 70\% since its peak, causing significant financial loss for individuals and cooperation’s. Despite this significant impact to individuals and society, cybersecurity standards and financial governance regulations are still in their infancy, specifically in the UK.},

  abstract = {As the world is gradually moving towards digitization, forgery of vital digital documents has become relatively easy. Therefore, the need for efficient and secure verification and authentication practices of digital documents is also increasing. Self-sovereign identity (SSI) is a set of technologies that build on core concepts in identity management, blockchain technology, and cryptography. SSI enables entities to create fraud-proof verifiable credentials and instantly verify the authenticity of a digital credential. The online document verification solutions must deal with a myriad of issues in regard to privacy and security. Moreover, various challenging and tedious processes have made document verification overly complex and time-consuming which motivated us to conduct this research. This work presents a novel framework for online document verification based on SSI technology. The solution address the complexity and interoperability issues that are present in the current digital document verification systems. We look at a particular use case, i.e., document verification in online loan processing and evaluate how this proposed approach can make an impact on the existing system. Our solution based on SSI standards replaces the intermediary and enables trust between players in the ecosystem. The technology also holds the potential to make the system more efficient, interoperable, and privacy-preserving.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The exponential growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) has driven considerable advancements in many domains, such as healthcare, smart cities, and industrial automation. However, this connectivity introduces a broad attack surface, making IoT ecosystems vulnerable to sophisticated cyberattacks, including Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attacks, and data breaches, which may severely degrade the Quality of Service (QoS) metrics, that may include latency, throughput, and packet loss. This paper provides a detailed survey of contemporary attack detection techniques, such as signature-based, anomaly-based and hybrid methods, focusing on their efficiency in securing IoT systems without undermining QoS. The impact of these methods on critical QoS parameters is analyzed in resource-constrained IoT environments, where computational and memory limitations deter the implementation of traditional security measures. Additionally, emerging approaches such as artificial intelligence (AI)-driven anomaly detection, federated learning, and blockchain are examined for their potential to balance robust security with optimal performance. The analysis reveals the trade-offs between detection accuracy, resource consumption, and QoS maintenance, identifying research gaps related to post-attack recovery mechanisms and real-time adaptive security models. A cross-domain comparison of attack detection techniques reveals how different IoT applications, from smart healthcare to industrial IoT, impact the performance of these solutions. The results provide direction for future research on developing scalable, resource-efficient security models that can maintain high QoS levels in complex IoT ecosystems.},

  abstract = {The eIDAS regulation aims to provide an interoperable European framework to enable EU citizens to authenticate and communicate with services of other Member States by using their national electronic identity. While a number of high-level requirements (e.g., related to privacy and security) are established to make interoperability among Member States possible, the eIDAS regulation does not explicitly specify the technologies that can be adopted during the development phase to meet the requirements as mentioned earlier. To the best of our knowledge, there is no work available in the literature investigating the technological trends within the notified eIDAS electronic identity schemes used by Member States. To fill this gap, this paper analyzes how the different technological trends of notified schemes satisfy the requirements of the eIDAS regulation. To do this, we define a set of research questions that allow us to investigate the correlations between different design dimensions such as security, privacy, and usability. Based on these findings, we provide a set of lessons learned that would be valuable to the security community, as they can provide useful insights on how to more efficiently protect interoperable national digital identities. Furthermore, we provide a brief overview regarding the new eIDAS regulation (eIDAS 2.0) that aims to provide a more privacy-preserving electronic identity solution by moving from a centralized approach to a decentralized one.},

This approach aligns with GDPR and similar regulations and is gaining adoption across various governments, non-profit organizations, and commercial entities worldwide. A foundational element in SSI is a Verifiable Data Registry (VDR), which serves as a trusted repository for registering and accessing public keys, schemas, identifiers, and other data. A natural choice for a VDR is a distributed ledger or blockchain. Among the most stable and popular frameworks for SSI is Hyperledger Indy. Indy includes a custom implementation of a public permissioned ledger as a VDR. The Indy community has been developing a new experimental approach for a VDR in Indy: a permissioned ledger based on Hyperledger Besu. In this paper, we are going to discuss the importance, benefits, and technical details of this initiative.},

  abstract = {Quantum Computers (QCs) differ radically from traditional computers and can efficiently solve mathematical problems fundamental to our current cryptographic algorithms. Although existing QCs need to accommodate more qubits to break cryptographic algorithms, the concern of ''Store-Now-Decrypt-Later'' (i.e., adversaries store encrypted data today and decrypt them once powerful QCs become available) highlights the necessity to adopt quantum-safe approaches as soon as possible. In this work, we investigate the performance impact of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) on TLS 1.3. Different signature algorithms and key agreements (as proposed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)) are examined through black- and white-box measurements to get precise handshake latencies and computational costs per participating library. We emulated loss, bandwidth, and delay to analyze constrained environments. Our results reveal that HQC and Kyber are on par with our current state-of-the-art, while Dilithium and Falcon are even faster. We observed no performance drawback from using hybrid algorithms; moreover, on higher NIST security levels, PQC outperformed any algorithm in use today. Hence, we conclude that post-quantum TLS is suitable for adoption in today's systems.},

This paper explores hardware-enforced cyber-security for critical infrastructures. It examines a quantum-safe “Software-Defined-Deterministic IIoT” (SDD-IIoT), with a new forwarding-plane (sub-layer-3a) for deterministic M2M traffic flows. A “Software-Defined Networking” (SDN) control plane controls many “Software-Defined-Deterministic Wide-Area Networks” (SDD-WANs), realized with FPGAs. The SDN control plane provides an “Admission-Control/Access-Control” system for network-bandwidth, using collaborating Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based “Zero Trust Architectures” (ZTAs). Hardware-enforced access-control eliminates all congestion, BufferBloat, and DoS/DDoS attacks, significantly reduces buffer-sizes, and supports ultra-reliable-low-latency communications in the forwarding-plane. The forwarding-plane can: (i) Encrypt/Authenticate M2M flows using quantum-safe ciphers, to withstand attacks by Quantum Computers; (ii) Implement “guaranteed intrusion detection systems” in FPGAs, to detect cyber-attacks embedded within billions of IIoT packets; (iii) Provide guaranteed immunity to external cyber-attacks, and exceptionally strong immunity to internal cyber-attacks; (iv) Save USD 100s of billions annually by exploiting FPGAs; and (v) Enable hybrid Classical-Quantum networks, by integrating a “quantum key distribution” (QKD) network with a classical forwarding plane with exceptionally strong cyber-security, determined by the computational hardness of cracking Symmetric Key Cryptography. Extensive experimental results for an SDD-WAN over the European Union are reported.},

Traditional e-health systems facilitate EHR sharing among healthcare providers but also introduce significant privacy risks, such as unauthorized access and data breaches. Blockchain, when integrated with privacy-preserving techniques, enhances transparency, integrity, and availability in EHR management. Smart contracts further strengthen security by enabling automated authentication and access control. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of blockchain-based access control frameworks in healthcare, categorizing them into permissioned and permissionless approaches. It also explores cryptographic privacy-preserving techniques designed to mitigate privacy risks. Additionally, blockchain platforms and consensus protocols commonly used in these frameworks are analyzed. The methodology follows a structured paper selection process, leading to the final inclusion of 45 research papers focusing on blockchain-based privacy preservation and access control in healthcare. Furthermore, it presents real-world case studies that illustrate the practical implementation of blockchain-based access control in healthcare settings, highlighting their strengths and challenges. Finally, it identifies privacy-related challenges, open research issues, and future directions to guide further research in this evolving domain.},

  abstract = {With the rapid proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and mobile applications and the growing demand for low-latency services, edge computing has emerged as a transformative paradigm that brings computation and storage closer to end users. However, the dynamic nature and limited resources of edge networks bring challenges such as load imbalance and high latency while satisfying user requests. Service migration, the dynamic redeployment of service instances across distributed edge nodes, has become a key enabler for solving these challenges and optimizing edge network characteristics. Moreover, the low-latency nature of edge computing requires that service migration strategies must be in real time in order to ensure latency requirements. Thus, this paper presents a systematic survey of real-time service migration in edge networks. Specifically, we first introduce four network architectures and four basic models for real-time service migration. We then summarize four research motivations for real-time service migration and the real-time guarantee introduced during the implementation of migration strategies. To support these motivations, we present key techniques for solving the task of real-time service migration and how these algorithms and models facilitate the real-time performance of migration. We also explore latency-sensitive application scenarios, such as smart cities, smart homes, and smart manufacturing, where real-time service migration plays a critical role in sustaining performance and adaptability under dynamic conditions. Finally, we summarize the key challenges and outline promising future research directions for real-time service migration. This survey aims to provide a structured and in-depth theoretical foundation to guide future research on real-time service migration in edge networks.},

With an emphasis on contrasting well‐known lightweight block ciphers and pointing out areas for future research, this paper examines the most recent developments in lightweight cryptographic methods. In order to synthesize insights into present issues and future goals, it explores cutting‐edge methods that improve performance, security, and energy efficiency. Among the main trends that were covered were the trade‐offs between resource limitations and security strength, hardware–software co‐optimization, block and stream cipher optimization, and hybrid encryption techniques.
