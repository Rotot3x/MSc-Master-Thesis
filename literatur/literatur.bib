  abstract = {In this work, we present a set of comprehensive experimental studies on Hyperledger Besu in private blockchain. We aim to exhibit its performance characteristics in terms of transaction throughput, latency, resource utilization, and scalability, from the application perspective by adding a load balancer middleware. We have carefully designed a set of comparative experiments and judiciously selected typical parameters, including transaction send rate, network size, node flavor, load balancing, consensus, and block time. In particular, three proof of authority consensus algorithms, Clique, IBFT 2.0, and QBFT, are investigated. Through extensive experimental evaluations using the Hyperledger Caliper benchmark tool, we analyze how these parameters impact the performance of a private Besu blockchain. Our studies reveal several interesting findings: 1) Blockchain parameters, e.g., block time and block size, are the most significant factors in determining Besu performance; 2) The performance of Besu is bottlenecked by transaction execution and blockchain state updates, which are determined by parameters such as node computation power, transaction complexity, and load balancing; 3) A Besu network with QBFT consensus can scale up to 14 validators without noticeable performance loss. Our findings shed some light on further performance improvement of Hyperledger Besu. The identified bottlenecks and root cause analysis provide insightful suggestions for blockchain practitioners to build performant enterprise applications.},

  abstract = {The use of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) systems for digital identity management is gaining traction and interest. Countries such as Bhutan have already implemented an SSI infrastructure to manage the identity of their citizens. The EU, thanks to the revised eIDAS regulation, is opening the door for SSI vendors to develop SSI systems for the planned EU digital identity wallet. These developments, which fall within the sovereign domain, raise questions about individual privacy. The design of SSI systems is complex, often characterized by a large number of components and architectural choices because the current SSI communities differ on how to create identifiers, how to build and present credentials, and even how to design a user wallet. SSI stacks developed by different organizations provide different privacy features for different privacy needs. This paper performs a systematic mapping and review of SSI components and technologies into a novel four-layer privacy framework to address the design complexity of SSI systems. Based on this review, we provide an accompanying Design Assistance Dashboard (DAD). The DAD shows the interdependencies between SSI components in different layers, and maps these components to different privacy requirements and considerations, even providing a simple privacy class for each component.},

  abstract = {Several revolutionary applications have been built on the distributed ledgers of blockchain (BC) technology. Besides cryptocurrencies, many other application fields can be found in smart systems exploiting smart contracts and Self Sovereign Identity (SSI) management. The Hyperledger Indy platform is a suitable open-source solution for realizing permissioned BC systems for SSI projects. SSI applications usually require short response times from the underlying BC network, which may vary highly depending on the application type, the used BC software, and the actual BC deployment parameters. To support the developers and users of SSI applications, we present a detailed latency analysis of a permissioned BC system built with Indy and Aries. To streamline our experiments, we developed a Python application using containerized Indy and Aries components from official Hyperledger repositories. We deployed our experimental application on multiple virtual machines in the public Google Cloud Platform and on our local, private cloud using a Docker platform with Kubernetes. We evaluated and compared their performance benchmarked by Read and Write latencies. We found that the local Indy ledger reads and writes 30–50\%, and 65–85\% faster than the Indy ledger running on the Google Cloud Platform, respectively.},

  abstract = {As the world is gradually moving towards digitization, forgery of vital digital documents has become relatively easy. Therefore, the need for efficient and secure verification and authentication practices of digital documents is also increasing. Self-sovereign identity (SSI) is a set of technologies that build on core concepts in identity management, blockchain technology, and cryptography. SSI enables entities to create fraud-proof verifiable credentials and instantly verify the authenticity of a digital credential. The online document verification solutions must deal with a myriad of issues in regard to privacy and security. Moreover, various challenging and tedious processes have made document verification overly complex and time-consuming which motivated us to conduct this research. This work presents a novel framework for online document verification based on SSI technology. The solution address the complexity and interoperability issues that are present in the current digital document verification systems. We look at a particular use case, i.e., document verification in online loan processing and evaluate how this proposed approach can make an impact on the existing system. Our solution based on SSI standards replaces the intermediary and enables trust between players in the ecosystem. The technology also holds the potential to make the system more efficient, interoperable, and privacy-preserving.},

  abstract = {Self-sovereign Identity (SSI) represents an approach to digital identity that prioritizes privacy and empowers individuals to maintain control over the information associated with their identity. This approach aligns with GDPR and similar regulations and is gaining adoption across various governments, non-profit organizations, and commercial entities worldwide. A foundational element in SSI is a Verifiable Data Registry (VDR), which serves as a trusted repository for registering and accessing public keys, schemas, identifiers, and other data. A natural choice for a VDR is a distributed ledger or blockchain. Among the most stable and popular frameworks for SSI is Hyperledger Indy. Indy includes a custom implementation of a public permissioned ledger as a VDR. The Indy community has been developing a new experimental approach for a VDR in Indy: a permissioned ledger based on Hyperledger Besu. In this paper, we are going to discuss the importance, benefits, and technical details of this initiative.},
